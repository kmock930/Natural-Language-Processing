talked me out of it we had a 2 or 3 hour chat about how to fix this and he even told me about this subreddit so to him i just want to say thanks for helping me get this far anyway i went to another game but played it through a 3rd party site at high school this got me through the days knowing i could come home and forget about all the shit and just relax but today i was banned from it without even breaking a rule i asked the guy that runs the site and he simply laughed at me shared it publicly and then deleted all the messages when i again asked if he could show me what rule i broke now

{"original_text":"dude i can t live i need help i wish i had people to talk toit s all overthree months ago probably longer now i lost my friend because my friend that makes all my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead got her to hate me completely i already have him blocked and know he s a toxic friend now and now i miss my friend not the toxic friend but the other oneand i go to her tumblr page and she i like the same things she likes but i tried to talk to her again yesterday and she blocked me her tumblr has all this stuff about anime and cartoons and games that i like and i think we d be good friends we were good friends for two years on tumblr and 11 years before that although i didn t see her for ten of them before my friend made her dislike meand my mom says i m not allowed to get a 12pack for three weeks because i stole a little bit of my dad s scotch a couple days agoand now i don t know how to deal with all of these little annoyances i woke up and i heard my mom s breathing machine and it sounds so annoying and i can t sleep like that either and i just wanted to do something horrible but then i realize they ll probably ban me from alcohol even longer my dad s coming home soon i wanna explode and say that i really want beer tomorrow even though i stole his scotch the other day but they say that s the only punishment i can haveand i got up and went to the bathroom and again my mom ran to the downstairs bathroom and tried talking to me from the downstairs bathroom so i went on the computer and a bug landed on my screen and both of my internet routers i don t know why we have two every time i bring it up my dad acts like i m crazy and then says he doesn t realize we even had two routers keep not working out good so my internet keeps dieing and i keep having to unplug and replug both of my routers constantlyand i keep venting over and over on tumblr again about how i miss my friend that my friend made dislike me but no one is interacting with me and i can t stand my mom harassing me and stuff she says even though i m 30 years old i can t buy new pants with my money to replace the dorky pants i have that always make me too hot because she bought me these pants when i was in school and she doesn t want me to replace them everyone says my mom always babies me she s going to die soon though she s on a breathing machine and stuffi can t live i feel bad that i lost my friend she keeps posting stuff on her tumblr that i relate to too i was always her friend until my best friend that always made my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead made her not like me same with my crush that always says i m hers she says mine and if i ever block her she posts on her facebook let s dig up some dirt on me

dont really know what happened ive been going through the motions for a while have a home paid off wife and kids but even still it seems likei amonly still here for everyone but myself if life were an amusement park ride it needed maintenance when it was my turn not looking for sympathy not looking for encouragement i simply need to know if anyone has any ideas to start enjoying things again as of now i wake up go to work watch my kids speak to my wife use the computer go to bed i sleep most of the weekend away or piddle with some pointless task i didnt start drinking until i was in my 30s and now thats pretty much the only solace that remainsi think about suicide about 10 times a day when i first wake up to go to work when i bring my kids to daycare when i sit down at my desk when i look at the clock and it isnt moving when i think about my life and my legacy pretty much anything real or lastingive failed at everything i set out to do in life and pretty much have just been going with the flow since my dream was to be a computer game designer whilei am not stupid or incapable of learning i simply lack any semblance of organization or follow through used to tell myself that it was probably for the best and id be going down a new and exciting path i never meant to take but its not the casei held out hope for years as the most cliched piece of support i typically receive advises

was a great friend for pretty much all my life he bid farewell when i was 17 needless to say i cried all that daymy first episode with depression was back when i was 14 i think i got expelled from my previous school and entered a new one i had a lot of behavioural isssues back then so i felt abandoned and like i had betrayed the friends i had not only that i aso felt i disappointed my mother this was the second time i was expelledbut fred tried to cheer me up he did his best so i wouldnt be sulky all day long and i even met a guy he was the first persona i talked to in that school and was really happy for the first time i thought everything would get better from thenhowever the next day i went to school i didnt find that guy anywhere needless to say i felt devastated had i done something wrong did i scare him somehow all those doubts were bugging me back then some years later i found him again i met other people and made new friends while looking for him and asked him why he had disappeared he told me he didnt like our classmates so he changed his classroom he felt terrible when i told him how i felt to this day he still feels bad for what he did but ive got no grudges against himso i was all alone during my first year at that school with the exception of that single kid i didnt get along with anyone else so that year i was friendless i used to help my arts teacher do some works during the breaks so i wouldnt be alone all day long i learnt the hard way the value of human interaction otherwise i would be reading in the hall ive done this since i was a kidone day

be seen as a weirdo i was an idiot i knowso i stopped eating for that week got some nasty hunger pangs and ate as much as i could when i got home i also ate a lot during the weekends so my mom became suspicious one day i was feeling really really hungry since waking up so i ate my snacks it eased the hunger pangs for a while but during spanish class that teacher really liked me i passed outi obviously dont remember everything i was sitting in my desk and lost consciousness next thing i remember everyone was standing by my side looking at me someone went for stretcher and they carried me

that any goal i put in front of myself whether its cleaning my room passing my college class not with an a just passing but everything i do that i dont set a goal for myself i do rather well and i feel like its some sort of shitty curse i gave to myself to forward my misery because god knows that no one else made me really unmotivated and lazy ive set goals up for myself and ive seen myself fail multiple times and it just hurts to see that happen and on top of thati ama very large dude and ive only gotten larger since i was done with football in high school and throughout my high school career no women would talk to me unless they actually wanted something from me like what were the answers for homework or using me as an into some football star and any advances ive made on people just crash and fail in a hindenberg of emotions and i usually just push everything down until i dont have to deal with it anymore which for most issues works most of the time ive also been in an accident where i killed a man walking home from dinner fault was on both sides i ran a red light because it was an angle to the light and i saw the green arrow for a left turn and as the angle came up i neglected to see the red light and drove past and hit him and on his side he was drunk high as a kite and literally half blind but none the less it was an incredible burden to put on a 17yearold kid who already feels pretty shitty about life oh also the prelude to all my emotional problems probably have root in the fact that my father was a raging alcoholic which to my siblings 3 all younger than me were thankfully spared from because there was quite a bit of space in years which meant that i was the most fit to make the drinks for my father and stay up past the other kids which put me in prime positions for his beatings until my mom who thankfully was never hurt decided that she had enough and took us away and finished her education and were pretty well off considering the fact on another note nice transition i know last year around this time i told my mother that i didnt want ive been having suicidal thoughts and it was only getting worse and worse i didnt tell my mother this but basically the only thing that was stopping me from killing myself was 1 my i didnt want my family to find my body thats a really shitting thing to do to the people that you care about along with the fact that my absence from the world permanently would really fuck up the entire family as i have close relationships with the majority of them at least them to me not so much me to them anymore ive slowly pushed most people away in annoyance to everything because people get really hard to tolerate sometimes also the other thing that prevented me from committing suicide was that i didnt have anything that i thought would end my life peacefully i had i shotgun and i love shooting it its a rather zhen thing just to shoot targets but that got taken away from me for obvious reasons after telling my mother which is difficult to explain that i wouldnt kill myself that way because i dont want to kill myself that way lol carrying on after i told my mom i agreed to be admitted to the hospital so i could get my noggin serviced unfortunately it was a rather full hospital that our insurance would cover so i had to sit in the psych er for a couple of days and that was just miserable i had to sit next to some legitimate loons in my passing who just got thrown in because the cops didnt want to deal with them and a lot and i mean a lot of girls who had a bad breakup essentially just being processed in and out as fast as they can the only person i could tolerate yes i know that all these people are suffering in their own way but i am not much of a people person to begin with so put me in with the rough patch of strawberries and it probably wont end up working out for my psyche was this recovering drug addict who got thrown in for being a loon in the bar part of town who was just struggling to get by in life and you could see the legitimate damage life could do to a man through his eyes i eventually got sick of waiting and really uncomfortable with having the cattle get brought in fed their pills and processed out so i decided to leave and leave i did and i didnt really have any serious issues because i was just glad to be out of there and didnt really think too much about it until nowi amstarting to have this feeling of worthlessness and selfpity and severe laziness creep back up in me and its a really shitty feeling and to be honest i probably would have killed myself if i wasnt so set in living in my moms attic with a highpowered pc and a vast catalog of games movies and tv shows to keep my mind chewing on something besides my shitty life whichi amprobably just too unmotivated to do anything about until its too late and i just get fed up with living a boring mundane and worthless life ps i also want to add that my best friend just left for boot camp a couple months ago and i mean he was like my serious best friend we got together like peanut butter and jelly but he got out of high school a year after me and enlisted because he thought itd be a good plan to get his life started and now thati amstarting to hear from him hes having talks about getting married and starting a family and moving on with his life within the next handful of years or so and thats somethingi am not willing to move to yet and if he moves on from life our ultimate selfinterests will just drive us apart in life until we maybe talk every now and then and losing my only nonmaterial release is just disheartening to me and i amlost because i now really have no friends and i am not the socialising type or really one to try to maintain friendships its just too much

will be able to change everything that i will be able to better myself start fresh meet people sooner end the pain the only other way i can end the pain is to just fucking kill myself and the only

point that they would literally create lots of arguments for me my sibling also had certain issue and moved far away to europe to get away from my family because they were causing her hell she tried explaining them but they wouldnt listen and would just laugh at her to the point she decided to sort of screw them and make her own choices since i am young i dont have to take any step for my relationship just yet but later on i may need to and just the thought about that stresses me my family thinks they are doing right in their own way and are trying to protect us while i was away to canada for university i got disconnected from them to the point that i was willing to stand up for myself for what i believe in and also i sort of started hating them for dividing the family so much however whenever i go back home to france my family show me so much love that i end up feeling guilty for everything i feel think believe etc for summer vacation i stayed with my family for 3 months back home and i got so connected that i feel soo depressed they seriously do a lot for me its just that they think what they are doing is right and no amount of argument or discussion is going to change their mind believe me i tried i was pretty much a family oriented person back when i was in high school my siblings were my bestfriends as i was bullied a lot in high school i have also been sexually assaulted i loved hanging with my family more than anyone else now its so hard my depression has increased to the point that i ended up getting bad grades have headaches all the time lost interest in my partner feel tired all the time just thinking about future makes me cry and the only way i feel a little relaxed is when i think ah perhaps i will die soon also i am having lots of problems with my university professers are shit degree is risky cos people who graduated from here some of them claimed that many faced problems cos of their degree as the university isnt accredited by the canadian law rather the country the university is originally from i talked to my family about it but they dont think anything would happen and just keep telling me dont listen to others i am so fed up of explaining them literally anything that i am just done i dont wanna do it now i am so stressed about literally everything career family future etc i dont know what the hell to do i just wanna kill myself the only thing holding me back from committing suicide is the thought of hell existing and me not knowing whether god is pleased with me or not\n\nQuestion: Does this post indicate

{"original_text":"i hate my life and wish i wasnt me very long post i recently turned 28 and really feel suicidal for a ton of reasons i didnt have the worst life out there lots of people have much worse lives then me but i honestly feel so deeply depressed about how my life has turned out my mother died last year we had a very difficult relationship my dad went missing a few weeks before my 6th birthday my last memory of him is inviting him to my birthday party and turned up around my birthday in a river we still have no idea what happened to him if it was an accident if he killed himself because of his believed schizophrenic disorders murder who knows my parents already had a bad relationship and werent living together at that point but it changed our lives of course my mother had a ton of mental health problems as well as chronic i willnesses due to having a highly abusive father growing up and a crippling injury and my dads death compounded them not to mention she was raising two children on her own on benefits one of whom was autistic me i was diagnosed with asperger syndrome around this time i love my mom very much but she could be incredibly abusive due to her problems i have memories of her spitting in my face grabbing my hair and shaking my head like a rag doll when she lost control screaming abuse when i knocked over a glass of water i have dyspraxia as well as aspergers which made me very clumsy and struggle with organisation when i was 10 a friend of my mothers went through a psychotic episode and acted like he was going to molest me if someone hadnt come along at that moment i still no idea what might have happened after he started hitting me on the arse and telling me to take my shorts down teenage years were hard as well my mother was very paranoid and i wasnt allowed out the house on my own until i was almost sixteen i had to have an escort walk me to and from school i spent most of primary school and high school being bullied for various reasons and i desperately wanted to make friends yet lacked the social skills to make them often offending people without meaning to and being incredibly defensive so on the rare occasion someone wanted to befriend me i would often be too scared to take them up on it or not realise it it didnt help that mom would often prevent me from doing normal social stuff on the rare occasions i was invited i was also struggling with my sexuality i realised from an early age that i was attracted to boys yet i did my best to suppress this i was already being bullied for being the retard and the special needs kid and was often called faggot and so forth i didnt want to be the weird gay kid as well i didnt want all the bullies who called me faggot to be right so i tried to force myself to be attracted to girls even though i felt nothing towards them it was easier to be in denial then accept i liked boys not girls mom was often quite homophobic she would say some pretty nasty things about gay men and while she had gay friends she found two men having sex to be revolting when she realised i was gay she was quite nasty about it for a while accusing me of prostituting myself for old men she would go through my phone and delete messages from boys i also really hated my body i often thought i was fat or obese but this was because i developed man boobs when i was 12 and was extremely paranoid about them despite actually fluctuating from being very skinny to a modest amount of pudge throughout my life i thought i was obese or extremely fat and ive never taken my shirt off in public as a result even though all i badly wanted to it also made dating extremely difficult on top of everything else it made me absolutely loathe my body it didnt help that i had acne on top of everything else was bullied for my prominent front teeth and my feminine facial features i was often mistaken for a girl i was also born with a small bladder until i was 14 i had to wear diapers to prevent me from wetting the bed and had to have quite a few procedures before medication finally cured me one of which was having metal needles jammed up my urethra when i was six so when i finally cured one problem that led me to be extremely self conscious and miserable another popped up and completely ruined my confidence in my developing body that still hasnt gone away despite constantly struggling with exercise and diet because i was so lonely i turned to binge eating purging and hoarding to make myself feel better i was so controlled in every way that those were the only things i could turn to fill the void created by my loneliness i also hated birthdays a lot of traumatic things happened around them my godfather who was the closest thing i had to a father or indeed any male presence in my life eloped the day before i turned 15 so i had no one to teach me how to shave my fathers side of the family wanted nothing to do with us after dad died and would often try to bully my grandmother into disinheriting me and my sister and my mothers family who i loved very deeply were on the other side of the atlantic so i barely got to see them i did love my only surviving grandmother very deeply and some of my happiest childhood memories are of her she died some years ago and had resisted her daughters attempts to bully her to disinherit me and my sister though my aunts were incredibly hateful over this and did their best to remind me and my sister that they considered us thieves and entitled brats for not giving them their brothers share of my grandmothers estate i miss my grandma so very much she was one of the few people who ever gave me unconditional love and sometimes i play the music box i got her for christmas one year and think of her it was a snow globe with her favourite flowers and bird inside it and i feel so deeply nostalgic when i play it i eventually got into my dream university but because of my severe depression i would just lock myself in my dorm room binge eat and cry having absolutely no idea how to break out of it i was very lonely it ended up feeling more like the bell jar then my dreams finally coming true by the time it was over i came very close to killing myself and spent most of that year in a suicidally depressed state i eventually got to redo my final year and made some wonderful friends who became a surrogate family i was still sexually and romantically frustrated due to my binge eating finally taking its toll and i gained a lot of weight during my depressive episode eventually i graduated and had to move out but i was finally happy in many ways due to finally getting the social life i wanted i finally was getting invited to parties and doing fun things mom had gotten very i will at this time so i spent the year after graduating struggling to sort out my life and look after her at the same time she became more and more emotionally volatile as her mental health was affected by her physical healths rapid decline eventually i took my life savings together and moved out thinking i could look after her better if i had my own space and i was tired of feeling ripped apart by loving her and resenting her for so many things six weeks later i got a call from the hospital saying she had been admitted for the next three months she was in and out of the hospital i hated going there i had put everything on the line to get my own place and fix my life and let go of the past and i kept having to go to a hospital and see my mother decline throw tantrums when she would ask me to bring or buy certain thing for her and then change her mind all the while biting my tongue because i didnt want to lose my temper in a ward full of frail old ladies coughing blood and even though i had really really thought i hated my mother at this point i still loved her and hated to see her suffer so much my mental health had already been dangling by a thread for quite some time eventually we got another call from the hospital and my mother passed that evening from multiple organ failure i remember staring at the heart monitor praying with every fibre of my being for it to keep going holding my mothers hand until the nurse said her heart had stopped and the machine was switched off i said goodbye to my mom and felt deep anguish she was never going to meet her grandchildren something she deeply wanted for all her flaws as a mother she loved children and it would have been so healing to see her as a devoted grandmother i smoked a cigarette outside and spent the next few days crying my heart out things got even worse my mother had not made a will and since the area we lived in the area that had been full of stabbings all my life was now a very gentrified area the house was now worth a lot of money which meant an insane amount of inheritance tax my mother was a very bad hoarder as well so the past year and a half has been struggling to clear out her things and make the huge inheritance tax bill the first of which came six months after her death i eventually had to move out of my place and back into the family home due to the inheritance tax taking all my savings and inheritance and now i guess ive reached my breaking pointi am28 still have man boobs have no money havent had a boyfriend in eight years coming up to nine have never had a job just volunteer work and have missed out on so much of life when i clear out moms stuff and take it to the charity shop the loss hits me so many things are mixed up in there and it reminds me of times when i was either happy or hopeful for the future and it feels so bitter that i cant go back to those times all thats left of my parents are two urns sitting side by side containing their ashes my sister lives overseas so i have no family left in the country i just want to redo my life and not be autistic or gay or have man boobs or have had so many mental and physical health problems or have had more family around me growing up people who could have gotten me away from my mother and taught me to be an adult so i wouldnt have been so emotionally stunted and isolated for most of my life helped me get into shape helped me grow up so i could have had a social life in my teens and twenties maybe even gotten to the point where i could have had a nice boyfriend or two instead of years of sexual and romantic frustration i see my friends still but sometimes its painful because it reminds me of how different my life has been from theirs they had families are in relationships are in careers and have had financial stability growing up some of them are going on holiday and backpacking through exciting places yet me i am absolutely broke from having to pay a huge tax bill every year i dont know i keep slipping into these daydreams were i didnt have so much shit happen to me where i am not autistic where i didnt have such an unstable upbringing where i met a nice boyfriend and didnt have these two things on my chest that absolutely ruined my confidence that wouldnt shift no matter how much exercise i did a guy who i could go on dates with play games with snuggle up to at night and have a satisfying sex life with someone who would take me home to meet his family i wish my parents were still alive and had been a bit more normal i wish i wasnt born with so many things wrong with my body and mind that came together to make me far more isolated and sad then i could bear i wish i had had a big family around me growing up i just wish i had had a bit more stability and normality then all this chaos i dont know i am on the waiting list for grief therapy and i see a counsellor but i feel so deeply sad about how much of life i have missed out on and am still missing out on due to being held back by such a crippling amount of debt i want to kill myself but i know i couldnt do that to my loved ones i dont know why i wrote this venting i guess i keep wishing i could redo my life i wish some pieces had come together better like if i had to be autistic i didnt have to be gay as well if i had to lose my dad i didnt have to lose my mom as well that my mom hadnt had so many things wrong with her because she wasnt a bad person just very damaged physically and mentally that my family in america had been around so they could have given me a bit more of a balanced upbringing that my uncle and aunts had been around to get my mom to back off a bit that my cousins had been the big brothers i needed to be a man teach me to shave take me out helped me work out how to socialise that i had my baby cousins to look after read stories too play games with because i always wanted to be a big brother too and was often sad that i didnt have babies and kids to look after i have two godchildren which has been wonderful but it does make me wistful that i never had any younger siblings growing up that i had known that man boobs could have been fixed with surgery so i knew what it was like to take my shirt off at the beach i wish i could have more experience with dating instead of hooking up with older men as no one my age gave me the time of day i wish i had a nice boyfriend i wish i hadnt had a hormone imbalance that made me loathe my body and made me bundle myself up in clothes to hide it and never take my shirt off i feel selfish for wanting to turn back time as the world doesnt revolve around my happiness i just wish there had been a bit more balance i didnt expect a happy life handed to me on a platter i just wish so many burdens hadnt been given to me that prevented me from having the life i wanted i just wish i could redo my teens and twenties without some of them so things were a bit more bearable and happy and less of a lonely isolating struggle theres a lot more i havent mentioned but i just wish i could wake up and have it be a long time ago before so many things got worse and worse i know its very self indulgent because some people have it so much worse but i just hate myself and i hate being me i just wish things hadnt been such a struggle and i wasnt going through losing my mom and having a colossal financial crisis on top of everything else i guess losing my mom has opened up a lot of old wounds its made me feel wistful for past times and deeply miss my dad and grandma and wish i could have had things be a bit more normal to be a bit more like my peers and be in a bitter place to cope with this loss now i wish it was years ago making my grandma a cup of tea and sitting in the garden with her or playing ocarina of time for the first time that magical moment when a boy kissed me for the first time time passes it feel so strange there was a time when i was a child or a young teen or a twenty year old and i actually had hope that things would get better instead of so much worse it feels sad that i feel nostalgic for those fleeting moments of happiness in a life ive found often so very sad and unbearably lonely i feel like wanting to hit the reset button makes me a bad person its impossible and selfish like the whole world revolves around my happiness i cant help it though if i could make those daydreams of being young and in love and having my family be more normal and alive around and getting to be more social as a teen and twenty something happen i would i know its a lot of whine here but i guess i just wanted to get things off my chest i know i have to a accept the past and that its gone and its written but i just wish things had been less awful i keep thinking if this was how my life was going to be why was i born i didnt ask to be an orphaned gay autistic man child with tits from a poverty stricken unstable background thats never been in love and has been so very very lonely for almost my entire life sometimes i wish id never been born or id killed myself years ago thank you for reading","cleaned_text":"i hate my life and wish i wasnt me very long post i recently turned 28 and really feel suicidal for a ton of reasons i didnt have the

friends yet lacked the social skills to make them often offending people without meaning to and being incredibly defensive so on the rare occasion someone wanted to befriend me i would often be too scared to take them up on it or not realise it it didnt help that mom would often prevent me from doing normal social stuff on the rare occasions i was invited i was also struggling with my sexuality i realised from an early age that i was attracted to boys yet i did my best to suppress this i was already being bullied for being the retard and the special needs kid and was often called faggot and so forth i didnt want to be the weird gay kid as well i didnt want all the bullies who called me faggot to be right so i tried to force myself to be attracted to girls even though i felt nothing towards them it was easier to be in denial then accept i liked boys not girls mom was often quite homophobic she would say some pretty nasty things about gay men and while she had gay friends she found two men having sex to be revolting when she realised i was gay she was quite nasty about it for a while accusing me of prostituting myself for old men she would go through my phone and delete messages from boys i also really hated my body i often thought i was fat or obese but this was because i developed man boobs when i was 12 and was extremely paranoid about them despite actually fluctuating from being very skinny to a modest amount of pudge throughout my life i thought i was obese or extremely fat and ive never taken my shirt off in public as a result even though all i badly wanted to it also made dating extremely difficult on top of everything else it made me absolutely loathe my body it didnt help that i had acne on top of everything else was bullied for my prominent front teeth and my feminine facial features i was often mistaken for a girl i was also born with a small bladder until i was 14 i had to wear diapers to prevent me from wetting the bed and had to have quite a few procedures before medication finally cured me one of which was having metal needles jammed up my urethra when i was six so when i finally cured one problem that led me to be extremely self conscious and miserable another popped up and completely ruined my confidence in my developing body that still hasnt gone away despite constantly struggling with exercise and diet because i was so lonely i turned to binge eating purging and hoarding to make myself feel better i was so controlled in every way that those were the only things i could turn to fill the void created by my loneliness i also hated birthdays a lot of traumatic things happened around them my godfather who was the closest thing i had to a father or indeed any male presence in my life eloped the day before i turned 15 so i had no one to teach me how to shave my fathers side of the family wanted nothing to do with us after dad died and would often try to bully my grandmother into disinheriting me and my sister and my mothers family who i loved very deeply were on the other side of the atlantic so i barely got to see them i did love my only surviving grandmother very deeply and some of my happiest childhood memories are of her she died some years ago and had resisted her daughters attempts to bully her to disinherit me and my sister though my aunts were incredibly hateful over this and did their best to remind me and my sister that they considered us thieves and entitled brats for not giving them their brothers share of my grandmothers estate i miss my grandma so very much she was one of the few people who ever gave me unconditional love and sometimes i play the music box i got her for christmas one year and think of her it was a snow globe with her favourite flowers and bird inside it and i feel so deeply nostalgic when i play it i eventually got into my dream university but because of my severe depression i would just lock myself in my dorm room binge eat and cry having absolutely no idea how to break out of it i was very lonely it ended up feeling more like the bell jar then my dreams finally coming true by the time it was over i came very close to killing myself and spent most of that year in a suicidally depressed state i eventually got to redo my final year and made some wonderful friends who became a surrogate family i was still sexually and romantically frustrated due to my binge eating finally taking its toll and i gained a lot of weight during my depressive episode eventually i graduated and had to move out but i was finally happy in many ways due to finally getting the social life i wanted i finally was getting invited to parties and doing fun things mom had gotten very i will at this time so i spent the year after graduating struggling to sort out my life and look after her at the same time she became more and more emotionally volatile as her mental health was affected by her physical healths rapid decline eventually i took my life savings together and moved out thinking i could look after her better if i had my own space and i was tired of feeling ripped apart by loving her and resenting her for so many things six weeks later i got a call from the hospital saying she had been admitted for the next three months she was in and out of the hospital i hated going there i had put everything on the line to get my own place and fix my life and let go of the past and i kept having to go to a hospital and see my mother decline throw tantrums when she would ask me to bring or buy certain thing for her and then change her mind all the while biting my tongue because i didnt want to lose my temper in a ward full of frail old ladies coughing blood and even though i had really really thought i hated my mother at this point i still loved her and hated to see her suffer so much my mental health had already been dangling by a thread for quite some time eventually we got another call from the hospital and my mother passed that evening from multiple organ failure i remember staring at the heart monitor praying with every fibre of my being for it to keep going holding my mothers hand until the nurse said her heart had stopped and the machine was switched off i said goodbye to my mom and felt deep anguish she was never going to meet her grandchildren something she deeply wanted for all her flaws as a mother she loved children and it would have been so healing to see her as a devoted grandmother i smoked a cigarette outside and spent the next few days crying my heart out things got even worse my mother had not made a will and since the area we lived in the area that had been full of stabbings all my life was now a very gentrified area the house was now worth a lot of money which meant an insane amount of inheritance tax my mother was a very bad hoarder as well so the past year and a half has been struggling to clear out her things and make the huge inheritance tax bill the first of which came six months after her death i eventually had to move out of my place and back into the family home due to the inheritance tax taking all my savings and inheritance and now i guess ive reached my breaking pointi am28 still have man boobs have no money havent had a boyfriend in eight years coming up to nine have never had a job just volunteer work and have missed out on so much of life when i clear out moms stuff and take it to the charity shop the loss hits me so many things are mixed up in there and it reminds me of times when i was either happy or hopeful for the future and it feels so bitter that i cant go back to those times all thats left of my parents are two urns sitting side by side containing their ashes my sister lives overseas so i have no family left in the country i just want to redo my life and not be autistic or gay or have man boobs or have had so many mental and physical health problems or have had more family around me growing up people who could have gotten me away from my mother and taught me to be an adult so i wouldnt have been so emotionally stunted and isolated for most of my life helped me get into shape helped me grow up so i could have had a social life in my teens and twenties maybe even gotten to the point where i could have had a nice boyfriend or two instead of years of sexual and romantic frustration i see my friends still but sometimes its painful because it reminds me of how different my life has been from theirs they had families are in relationships are in careers and have had financial stability growing up some of them are going on holiday and backpacking through exciting places yet me i am absolutely broke from having to pay a huge tax bill every year i dont know i keep slipping into these daydreams were i didnt have so much shit happen to me where i am not autistic where i didnt have such an unstable upbringing where i met a nice boyfriend and didnt have these two things on my chest that absolutely ruined my confidence that wouldnt shift no matter how much exercise i did a guy who i could go on dates with play games with snuggle up to at night and have a satisfying sex life with someone who would take me home to meet his family i wish my parents were still alive and had been a bit more normal i wish i wasnt born with so many things wrong with my body and mind that came together to make me far more isolated and sad then i could bear i wish i had had a big family around me growing up i just wish i had had a bit more stability and normality then all this chaos i dont know i am on the waiting list for grief therapy and i see a counsellor but i feel so deeply sad about how much of life i have missed out on and am still missing out on due to being held back by such a crippling amount of debt i want to kill myself but i know i couldnt do that to my loved ones i dont know why i wrote this venting i guess i keep wishing i could redo my life i wish some pieces had come together better like if i had to be autistic i didnt have to be gay as well if i had to lose my dad i didnt have to lose my mom as well that my mom hadnt had so many things wrong with her because she wasnt a bad person just very damaged physically and mentally that my family in america had been around so they could have given me a bit more of a balanced upbringing that my uncle and aunts had been around to get my mom to back off a bit that my cousins had been the big brothers i needed to be a man teach me to shave take me out helped me work out how to socialise that i had my baby cousins to look after read stories too play games with because i always wanted to be a big brother too and was often sad that i didnt have babies and kids to look after i have two godchildren which has been wonderful but it does make me wistful that i never had any younger siblings growing up that i had known that man boobs could have been fixed with surgery so i knew what it was like to take my shirt off at the beach i wish i could have more experience with dating instead of hooking up with older men as no one my age gave me the time of day i wish i had a nice boyfriend i wish i hadnt had a hormone imbalance that made me loathe my body and made me bundle myself up in clothes to hide it and never take my shirt off i feel selfish for wanting to turn back time as the world doesnt revolve around my happiness i just wish there had been a bit more balance i didnt expect a happy life handed to me on a platter i just wish so many burdens hadnt been given to me that prevented me from having the life i wanted i just wish i could redo my teens and twenties without some of them so things were a bit more bearable and happy and less of a lonely isolating struggle theres a lot more i havent mentioned but i just wish i could wake up and have it be a long time ago before so many things got worse and worse i know its very self indulgent because some people have it so much worse but i just hate myself and i hate being me i just wish things hadnt been such a struggle and i wasnt going through losing my mom and having a colossal financial crisis on top of everything else i guess losing my mom has opened up a lot of old wounds its made me feel wistful for past times and deeply miss my dad and grandma and wish i could have had things be a bit more normal to be a bit more like my peers and be in a bitter place to cope with this loss now i wish it was years ago making my grandma a cup of tea and sitting in the garden with her or playing ocarina of time for the first time that magical moment when a boy kissed me for the first time time passes it feel so strange there was a time when i was a child or a young teen or a twenty year old and i actually had hope that things would get better instead of so much worse it feels sad that i feel nostalgic for those fleeting moments of happiness in a life ive found often so very sad and unbearably lonely i feel like wanting to hit the reset button makes me a bad person its impossible and selfish like the whole world revolves around my happiness i cant help it though if i could make those daydreams of being young and in love and having my family be more normal and alive around and getting to be more social as a teen and twenty something happen i would i know its a lot of whine here but i guess i just wanted to get things off my chest i know i have to a accept the past and that its gone and its written but i just wish things had been less awful i keep thinking if this was how my life was going to be why was i born i didnt ask to be an orphaned gay autistic man child with tits from a poverty stricken unstable background thats never been in love and has been so very very lonely for almost my entire life sometimes i wish id never been born or id killed myself years ago thank you for reading\n\nQuestion: Does this post indicate suicidal intentions?

much much worse when i realise what is really going on in those events and how much of a failure i amthere are lots of issues that i have so far but one of the main ones is you guessed it virginity and girls many websites and newspapers claim that one of the big things that will happen during freshers week is the romance or getting with someone whether its a simple dance making out or actually

{"original_text":"long story of my shitty life so this all started around 5 years ago when my great grandad died i didnt know him very well as i was around 8 or 9 at the time but when he died all i remember is my mum lying with my dogs crying her eyes out i now know this is because my mum didnt have a dad growing up so she saw him as one my great grandad dying caused my mum to become heavily depressed which soon progressed into alcoholismmy mum being an alcoholic it has been going on for around 5 years now but i will just tell you all the times i can remember that are significant first one is around 3 4 years ago my mum got shit faced and left we found her a few hours later i say we but it was my brother and dad as i was 10 and she came back and yelled then passed out second time was a repeat of 1 just around a year later it happened a few times 6th time biggest it was november 5th and my family was throwing a bonfire for some friends of theres they used to be mine but i will get to that and we made a huge bonfire behind our house in a field but we left our mum and her friend because it was cold and they didnt vcare but by the time we had gotten back my mum had drank around 34 bottles of wine the equivalent of a pint of jd and was out of it later that night there friends have gone my brother was sleeping in my room because he was scared of my mum as when me and my dad were directing our guests back as they were wattlking she had being saying things to him like do you want to die she was drunk later that night we woke up to the sound of my mum banging and yelling at my dad alan i need a fucking wee then started throwing stuff and smashing stuff so my dad called the police and she was put in a drunk ward for a 12 hours final one for now it was around june and my brothers girlfriend was around and he had bought me some csgo keys and made me a coke and rumi am14 so there was 101 coke to rum and he had left like 100ml left and it was gone so he asked my mum and she started freaking out yelling at my brother girlfriend to get the fuck out of her house and that she is not welcome and the same at my brother and sines then around 2 and a half months i have seen him once and i had to spend the night at my mums friends house and she didnt pick up her phone and knowing how she is and what she has done before i thought she had slit her wrists and died this timemoving 200 miles away after what happened my parents decided to move back to the north of england moving closer to family i see once a year and 200 miles away from friends i now have 1 friend ish and see my cousins once a week and am living with my grandma who is a compleat bitch my family are still in nottingham and the reasoni am not friends with the other family is because of moving

guilti amhaunted by any longer i need advice because i cant live like this anymore and i just want to end it all no one loves me or cares about me at all and i just need someone to talk to ive started selling my things and getting ready to pick my date i know my post is long but i wanted to give the full picture its been 11 months since i put down my best friend of 16 years my cat i got when i was 9 years old i had a terrible abusive upbringing and he was my only source of support i hate myself for what ive done and ive suffered everyday i cry so hard almost every night to the point that i throw upi feel like i missed the obvious warning signs over his last few months he was keeping to himself and started urinating out of his litter box vomiting often and he got so thin he was a very large cat before and i had put him on a diet so i thought he lost weight from that and i started to feed him more again but he didnt gain any back i took him to the vet to discuss his urinating out of the litter box and vomiting and she told me it was stress and old age and to try a bunch of different stuff that didnt help much changing his food helped a little so i just thought he had a sensitive stomach and neglectedly left it at that i remember being very busy his last month of life because it was october and i was all over the map doing halloween events i had finally made a friend and a was so excited i never wanted to say no to her when she wanted to hang out so i wasnt home much i didnt spend much time cuddling and playing and just plain loving him then i went to a halloween party and stayed at my friends overnight until late that day i got a text from a neighbour saying my cat was meowing a lot and to come home and check on him i brushed it off because he had a tendency to meow loudly when he was looking for me and i was really hungover and wanted to sleep more a few hours later i came home and found him cold and meowing in a tone i had never heard before i picked him up for the first time in a couple weeks and realised how light he had gotten he went limp in my arms and looked so sad he spent his last night and morning all alone and scared because i was out partying and didnt come home i have so much guilt and hatred towards myself for this i rushed him to the animal hospital where they did a bunch of tests and said he had kidney failure they gave me the choice to leave him in hospital until he was stable but then when he went home he would have to undergo fluid injections twice a day take pills and go for dialysis there was no guarantee of this being a cure the other choice was to put him down the vet said he wasnt in any pain so the decision was so hard in the end i realized i wouldnt be able to help him with all his care needs and i didnt want him to be poked with needles all the time and be subject to medications and side effects i now feel so selfish for this because i should have been willing to quit my job and take care of my cat when he needed me to care for him most before the vet came in to euthanize him i got some time to have him in my arms for the last time i couldnt stop crying i was about to murder my most loving and longest best friend i saw the little iv in his arm that they were going to use for the lethal injection and i cried he smelled so bad from the toxins that had built up in his body and he was so cold and wrapped in a blanket he walked away from me to go lay on the other side of the couch he could barely open his eyes and he had exudate coming from them he looked so unhappy i cant believe i wasnt there for him his last night and i left him alone to cry and be scared all morning i fell like the most horrible person on the earth the vet came in and i asked if i could hold him he jumped as she put in the first injection and then she put in the lethal injection and she asked me to lay him down she listened to his heart and i asked her if he was gone and she said yes i sat in the room crying petting his fur watching him just lay there dead because of me and what i just did i covered him with a blanket and left the love of my life alone in that room never to be seen again the amount of guilt and regret i feel every single day is enough to make me not want to go on in this life my actions haunt me everyday and no amount of people saying i did the right thing will ever make me feel like i did the right thing i dont know how to go on and accept what happened and ever be okay with myself i dont know how i can ever forgive myself for not spending everyday of that last month playing with him

She then started to look like a zombie and dropped everything school related , she went from getting A\u2019s to C\u2019s and she let her appearance go . \nA few weeks ago i was in the bathroom having my 7th nose bleed of the day and she asked to borrow my phone, she went into a stall and called her mom and she sobbed to her to just pick her up , when she came out she was bawling and saying she was just tired of life and i felt a gut punch . I realized that she might not be lying for the first time . \nI went to class and packed her shit while everyone starred cuz they knew we weren\u2019t talking but not the reason . I sat in class and shit i felt a panick attack coming on but i was in french and the teacher is really nosy but quite nice so i just masked it , i didn\u2019t want to pass out infront of everyone . \nWent home and started feeling like i should just jump . I made a list of the ways i could end it and crossed the worst options but i didn\u2019t want to plan it yet but by the second week of this shit i knew i wanted to die . Life has no meaning , i tried to get help and on tiktok i saw that watching 13 reasons why was a good way to cope , that show made things worse for me . \nI have always had anxiety but now i couldn\u2019t go a day whitout it . \nI felt like all life lost meaning and felt so fucking guilty for not being there for my friend tho she was horrible but she deserved sm1 that cared . I guess its karma or just that i finally understood her . \nBut now its much deeper than guilt it real intrusive and suicidal toughts and my anxiety gets so bad when i try to talk to her to right my wrong . I know that i seem pathetic and i have no reason to want to die but this is just how i feel \nPlease offer advice i need to know what to do i dont want to cause my family harm and go to hell for

she might not be lying for the first time . i went to class and packed her shit while everyone starred cuz they knew we werent talking but not the reason . i sat in class and shit i felt a panick attack coming on but i was in french and the teacher is really nosy but quite nice so i just masked it , i didnt want to pass out infront of everyone . went home and started feeling like i should just jump . i made a list of the ways i could end it and crossed the worst options but i didnt want to plan it yet but by the second week of this shit i knew i wanted to die . life has no meaning , i tried to get help and on tiktok i saw that watching 13 reasons why was a good way to cope , that show made things worse for me . i have always had anxiety but now i couldnt go a day whitout it . i felt like all life lost meaning and felt so fucking guilty for not being there for my friend tho she was horrible but she deserved sm1 that cared . i guess its karma or just that i finally understood her . but now its much deeper than guilt it real intrusive and suicidal toughts and my anxiety gets so bad when i try to talk to her to right my wrong . i know that i seem pathetic and i have no reason to want to die but this is just how i feel please offer advice i need to know what to do i dont want to cause my family harm and go to hell for ending things but idk anymore existence is meaningless","label":1,"source":"reddit","deepseek_prompt":"Post: i have felt suicidal for 3 weeks now but i have a great life my parents are divorced and mom is remarried and dad is bipolar but he loves me like crazy and mom is really kind a loving , they have a bit of toxicity like any other parents but they care , not enough clearly but i know they are trying their best i have siblings that are 14 and 16 years older and they care for me and provide shit and my sis also cares and i can talk to her but not about this when i was really young like 78 im 16 we were poor but now we can technically afford anything we need and a lot of what we want . i have friends and relatives that love me and shit im not an ugly or fat person im a girl who is 6ft and 60kg with long curly brown hair and everyone says im pretty . i have acne but then again who doesnt . i can only think of one thing that could cause this and im ashamed but also i dont understand my brain anymore . i have a friend 16 f and she is a bit crazy and a shitty friend who always fucks with me and my self esteem and does rude and mean things for no reason but just when i started to distance myself she dropped the bomb that she attempted suicide 5 times and since she has a pattern of lying i didnt believe her , i told only the principal and assured him to not tell anyone and stopped talking to her and i didnt tell anyone else and she retaliated by making everyone in class hate her with her actions they started to lightly bully her and i just ignored it all . she then started to look like a zombie and dropped

now coming onto 4 and the demands on my time are ridiculous its a boarding school so they can pretty much do with my time as they pleasei amtaking physics chemistry maths and further maths all subjects that i enjoy but i amdefinitely struggling to keep up with the work load for the past 3 years my extra curricular activities have so far been rugby and thats about it in 6th form you get to do a race called the devises to westminster race which is an incredibly long kayaking race in england takes a few terms of dedicated training to get to the required skill level but its an incredible experience had my first on water session today and due to a minibus breaking down on the way back from the riveri amabout 30 minutes late for a termly music scholar meeting i go to see the head of music to apologise and i try to explain what happened but he just shrugs and says its always this and that never your fault i am not performing the rolesi amexpected to as a scholar now fine i understand where hes coming from asi amsaving 15 of a 30k yearly tuition from this scholarship so obviously they expect something in return he asked me after the bollocking whether i wanted to be a scholar he said he was more than happy to phone my parents and tell them i was no longer a music scholar i said of course not i want to be a scholar however thats just a lie i hate being a music scholar being an academic scholar is fine as they only have weekly lectures but when the time i have to catch up on work my free periods my free time before and after breakfast and supper and occasionally my weekends are taken up by this musical demand i just cant take it anymore i just want to be able to spend an afternoon with my friends but instead i have daily music rehearsals for a handful of groups and instrumental lessons where i learn nothing now with this added work and all the additional work i need to do for further maths i feel i cant anything my parents have asked me whether i really want to be a music scholar and i feel like i have to say yes the tuition fees are 30k a year so with 15 off for music and 15 off for academic scholarships on top of a 35 bursary were already being given huge savings on tuition i dont know much about my parents financial situation but i know enough to know that i would not be able to stay at this school if i lost my music scholarshipi amsure we could amass the money somehow but with my dad having recently retired i just cant make them do that so if i stopped id have to change schools right at the start of one of the hardest couple of years in my education ive been here for 4 years now and i see it as my home away from home i know everyone i know all the teachers and i have become close with lots of people i cant leave now i just feel like everything would be so much easier if i just ceased to live i dont understand whyi ameven trying to live through this and it just strikes me as such a clear option its about the only thing i can think of that can solve this i dont want to have to wake up every morning to take part of a routine i hate it would be so much simpler to not wake up knowing i now cant go

internet which i know isnt exactly the smartest thing but heyi amhere might as wellokay so ive been suicidal and depressed on and off for a couple of years now i cant exactly tell you when it started since problems like this usually stem from childhood issues but i can say that it certainly started getting worse sometime around grade seven or eight now ive been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ocd and severe depression but i am not currently seeing any therapist due to my parents disbelief in mental i willness i think that they might not want to believe that their daughter has any type of problem at all or maybe this all ties into their general ignorance of things i dont hate my parents but i dont really believe in their values theyre racist homophobic my dad is sexist and my mother uses religion to justify everything she does okay back to me like i said i have a couple of mental issues with my depression and ocd probably being the worst of the bunch my ocd is very very disruptive of daily lifei am not particularly religious but i am not an atheist i am a 16 soon to be 17 year old girl and my sexuality is homosexual though i dont like the term lesbian very much due to its oversexualized connotation i like pretty boring stuff like writing reading and drawingi amparticularly interested in writing and i would like to become an author and hopefully slow down the death process of modern literature yeahi ama stud arent i i have relationship issues with my girlfriend but i wont get into that hereright now in a general reference to daily life i feel nothing nothing i can particularly say my emotions are somewhat normal if a bit exaggerated in the moment but on an overarching scale i feel fairly empty even so ive been thinking about killing myself i used to think that i gave up cutting after having a little dispute with my mother over the scabbylines on my wrist its been about two years since then and ive started cutting up my thighs on an almost daily basisi am not like one of those edgy teens where i cut because of the physical pain distracts from the emotional pain i think its simply because of the dopamine reward my brain gives me for doing something good ive just always had a slightly high pain tolerance and i find myself attracted to the pair of sharpened scissors hiding away in my desk drawer last night though i had used a different pair they were the closest thing to me at the time and i ended up cutting myself a nice little and by little i mean huge gash right across my thigh i almost thought i needed stitches for a second i remember the initial spark of pain and then there was nothing it wasnt the numbness of a severed nerve no it just didnt i pressed down on it to stop the bleeding no pain i could feel myself pressing down but it just wasnt accompanied by any pain it was an almost surreal experience for me thats got me thinking i havent killed myself out of fear for the pain since i live in canada with no guns and i have no access to tall buildings and i dont own a car or have access to any potentially lethal pills the only viable method of killing myself that i have are the knives in my kitchen i had held one against the throat in the past but never had the guts to bring it down i have imagined stabbing myself in the stomach on multiple occasions but could never actually pull a knife that leads me to wonder about slitting my wrists ive heard of how painful it is but right now i cant really find myself caring i dont particularly care about anything at all school is easy i have nineties in every class and i havent studied a single day in my life i dont ever have any homework to worry about because i finish it all in class with time to spare i have enough friends to satisfy me and a girlfriend

the truth of the matter is is that the problems began shortly after conception that genetic mishap that was placed inside your genetic sequencing that ticking time bomb that inevitably went off at the age of fourteen when you tried to commit suicide for the first time you stole your fathers pistol from his closet loaded it and pressed it to your temple it failed to fire because your father was a failure at maintaining his guns properly strangely upon remembering this i seem to find it a fitting metaphor for how you have turned out while your father was a failure at maintaining his guns you have become the same failure at maintaining personal relationships your work duties your own fatherly responsibilities all of which have led to other suicide attempts which predictably have ended in failure these are only a few of the many fuckups you have endured in your thirtyone years in life you have subsequently shown that you are incapable of interacting with people like a normal human being remember that night where you became everything you ever hated and attempted to rape that guy another failed suicide attempt followed that little endeavour you vowed to give up sex after that altogether swearing to become a better person you failed at that as well instead you married the person you slept with next sired two children they may love you dearly but she hates you you know she

many weeks at a time providing a pathetic excuse for a living for her and your two kids for fuck sakes the power has been turned off more times than you can count because you cant make enough money to keep it on youve failed as a provider you have failed as a husband you failed at marriageworst of all youve failed at being a good fatheryouve missed so much your sons first words and steps your daughters first days of first second and third grade youre worse than your father ever was and he had the audacity to call you a liar when you cried to him after being raped youre fucking worthless look at you self medicating in alcohol and weed masturbating twice a day constantly chasing that temporary high that will ultimately take the crushing weight of having fucked up every good thing that could have possibly come your wayto your credit youd never change your children theyre the only thing that gives you hope but maybe just maybe theyd be happier if you werent around one less white trash confused bisexual dad in the world to screw them up forever and ever couldnt hurt that much could it i mean look at yourself youre deeply unhappy youre mentally scarred terrified of everything

hold steadfast to the desperate need to try and hide from all of thisthats why i needed to write this letter this post for everyone to see youve been considering ending it again possibly taking someone with you despite the treatments for your steadily declining mental health you find yourself back in the depths of the darkness and its far worse than it ever has been before violent urges thoughts of self harm and suicide all of these things are piling up on you like an avalanche and you feel as though there is no one to talk to no one cares to listen anymore because youre such a fucking crybaby about your mental problems its cost you so many friends and even family members your wife wont even bother to listen to you anymore you are truly alone in the darkness and it is consuming you this time your inner demons finally winning out despite a decade of fighting like hell against them you could tell your doctor about it but hes already certain the medication that youre on is the thing that will make you normal againas if you were ever normal i really dont know how to end this letter i guess things like this dont ever end i will always be that voice in your head criticizing you telling you what you already know about yourself but refuse to acknowledge baring the truth in all its naked glory for you to try and shy away from i will be with you until the end

than it ever has been before violent urges thoughts of self harm and suicide all of these things are piling up on you like an avalanche and you feel as though there is no one to talk to no one cares to listen anymore because youre such a fucking crybaby about your mental problems its cost you so many friends and even family members your wife wont even bother to listen to you anymore you are truly alone in the darkness and it is consuming you this time your inner demons finally winning out despite a decade of fighting like hell against them you could tell your doctor about it but hes already certain the medication that youre on is the thing that will make you normal againas if you were ever normal i really dont know how to end this letter i guess things like this dont ever end i will always be that voice in your head criticizing you telling you what you already know about yourself but refuse to acknowledge baring the truth in all its naked glory for you to try and shy away from i will be with you until the end which needs to come sooner rather than later","label":1,"source":"twitter","deepseek_prompt":"Post: a letter to myself dear selfyou like to think that your problems began on christmas eve of the year 1993 when you were raped beaten and strangled you were a seven year old boy then the truth of the matter is is that the problems began shortly after conception that genetic mishap that was placed inside your genetic sequencing that ticking time bomb that inevitably went off at the age of fourteen when you tried to commit suicide for the first time you stole your fathers pistol from his closet loaded it and pressed it to your temple it failed to fire because your father was a failure at maintaining his guns properly strangely upon remembering this i seem to find it a fitting metaphor for how you have turned out while your father was a failure at maintaining his guns you have become the same failure at maintaining personal relationships your work duties your own fatherly responsibilities all of which have led to other suicide attempts which predictably have ended in failure these are only a few of the many fuckups you have endured in your thirtyone years in life you have subsequently shown that you are incapable of interacting with people like a normal human being remember that night where you became everything you ever hated and attempted to rape that guy another failed suicide attempt followed that little endeavour you vowed to give up sex after that altogether swearing to become a better person you failed at that as well instead you married the person you slept with next sired two children they may love you dearly but she hates you you know she does the way she glares at you when she thinks youre not looking the fact she now refuses to sleep in the same bedroom as you and becomes physically sick if you touch her the fact youre on the road many weeks at a time providing a pathetic excuse for a living for her and your two kids for fuck sakes the power has been turned off more times than you can count because you cant make enough money to keep it on youve failed as a provider you have failed as a husband you failed at marriageworst of all youve failed at being a good fatheryouve missed so much your sons first words and steps your daughters first days of first second and third grade youre worse than your father ever was and he had the audacity to call you a liar when you cried to him after being raped youre fucking worthless look at you self medicating in alcohol and weed masturbating twice a day constantly chasing that temporary high that will ultimately take the crushing weight of having fucked up every good thing that could have possibly come your wayto your credit youd never change your children theyre the only thing that gives you hope but maybe just maybe theyd be happier if you werent around one less white trash confused bisexual dad in the world to screw them up forever and ever couldnt hurt that much could it i mean look at yourself youre deeply unhappy youre mentally scarred terrified of everything barely able to take care of yourself ultimately you will die alone some nurses or doctors burden that theyd be annoyed to be obligated to try and help youre growing older fatter sadder and yet still hold steadfast to the desperate need to try and hide from all of thisthats why i

don t work on me part of me wants to fight this voice that lulls me into committing suicide part of me says there are ways to change my body and that god wouldn t give me this body to hate it there is a way for me to make some kind of supportive income so i don t have to rely on my husband hope is so seductive maybe i can find a way to fix this life and somehow enjoy it again wouldn t that be nice thanks for reading this i appreciate your time i hope you re not considering ending your physical existence there must be a reason we are encouraged to live our lives out as fully as we can there must be a reason why suffering happens the tiredness has to stop because i choose to make it go away life really is dictated by our thoughts so the more i wallow in this misery the more i create it that s how it works and it sucks because it s really easy for me to just surrender to the misery and live in the pit it feels so familiar to be miserable because i could blame my father for beating me as a kid i could give into the misery of surviving several sexual assaults when i was a little girl no one would question why i decided to end my life i won t kill myself today because i decided to hang on to the hope that i can change my body for the better and find a way to make a decent income it s out of curiosity to see how my life will turn out i can always kill myself if it gets really bad i always have that choice\n\nQuestion: Does this post indicate suicidal intentions?

well in the end it is my choice sowell dear you you are yourself crazy right oh still does not understand you are yourself look at the mirror or at the webcam you are the person who is by whatever reasons or means reading this note so uhm maybe i should confess to you whyi amwriting this right well its always up to you if youre going to read this or not so i hope you stay with me just a little longer maybe wait youre still here ha strange one okay well that means you do wanna understand why all this lets start by the beginning maybeso uhm that would start 23 years ago brazil yeah thats wheni amborn nononono dont worry wont take long to tell everything i will make it quick i was born mom and dad happily married wadahwadahwadah no thats not so true mom wasnt really happy with dad dad was kinda on drugs durign those days when i was three they broke up no this is not about being raised without a dad well maybe it is i wouldnt know the difference well maybe you can sort that out uhm oh yeah sorry i will keep going so 23 years old no dad i didnt miss him during those days though not that i remember well time goes on and i will enter school big school full of peoples and friends wouldnt call them that but okay i guess lets just say most little friends were not very friendly or we cant really remember much from those days can only remember being rejected qqcouple years later joined elementary school not sure how it works where you live but here we have 9years in elementary school then 3 in highschool then college so uhm 1st year i kinda learned to read except i already knew kinda well it was kinda fun 2nd year i dont really remember i remember i wasnt very popular and i remember i occasionally would shit myself yeah quite literally disgusting i know not very higienic also true but well that was when everything started to go wrong bullying and all thatit followed me untill i went to college the bullying no the shitting myself part that stopped somewhere before 5th year so uhm i will not talk about the bullying part here i dont want to wouldnt feel right so expect random cut offs and subjects those will be to run from the bullying subject okay so where was i oh yeah well i was kind of smart though so thats a plus kinda cuz i was way too talkative also and would run through all the class untill everyone would scold me and yell at me and all that well i just have always liked to play and since the subjects were kind of way too easy lol so i had nothing to focus on well lame excuese i get it but still that was me so uhm something else happenned at that time mommy got a boyfriend this big huge tall faaaaat boyfriend nice guy though rude as rock but nice i think uhm well he had 2 kids so i kinda got a brother and a sister i think that you would call the my brotherinlaw and sisterinlaw well we do not have a word for that here so they were them we would see each other every weekend once at my home once at their home untill 5thyear of elementary school oh by the way lemme tell who i used to live with momwould work all day usually we wouldnt see each other much as she usually would get home late and leave very early in the morning to work but weekends were great and she was the most absolutely gorgeous beautiful woman still when we would fight she had this anger inside against me as if she hheld some hatred towards me deep inside her because i was her exhusbands son but when we were not fighting she has always been the best grandmatakes care of her home untill today can barely walk without feeling pain in her ankles but would walk a thousand miles as long as there is some shop with well anything from clothes to house decoration but mainly shirts grandpaused to work a lot in an industryas a guard during the night and sleep during the afternoon later on he used to take kids to school on his kombiyup he had a school kombi certified and everything very funny caring and but wouldnt want to make him angry and last uncleoh uncle might write a whole sotry just about how he made my life hell not directly or willingly but still made it hell every morning he and grandma would argue about his religion or about what he wanted to eat or about his dick size or about how his chest was sunken in the middle yeah strange topics and i would listen to that everyday yeeah every single day annoying but i ended up getting used to it a videogamerpg addicted only good thing he gave mebesides the fact that once he looked at me and during an arguemente with my grandma he said that i didnt need to worry cuz my dick definitely would have a good size cuz my dads dick also had a goold size i had like 7 or 8 years oldwell these are the people that lived with me so uhm i had a few friends at the townhouse there were 10 buildings ifi am not mistaken so there were the summer friends those that would appear only in summer and the year long friends that would stay throughout the year there were a few and and whole lot lot of stories that are quite funny and interesting but none really important for this so lemme make the 2nd to 4th years quick2nd year i remember absolutely nothing besides shitting myself and everyone laughing at me thats it besides having the best grades of the class and being talkative as hell to whoever sit besides me wether they liked it or not though but of course this wasnt nice3rd year good teacher i fell in love with this blond girl that everyone else was in love with i had no chance and i felt really bad about that i still had the best grades kinda become the classs clown to try and make friends didnt work at all talked to mom about not having friends she argued with someone at school that wnet to class and kinda ordered other kids to make friends with me i felt like shit and learned that i should not talk to my mom about this otherwise id be only more embarrasesed about that at 6 to 7 years old my problems with friends would have to be my own and not anyone elses 4th year good teacher i fell in love with this other blond girl that everyone else fell in love also i still had no chance and felt even worse about that i still had the best grades had a rival that year good guy really funny not smart at all he failed completely that year also but he had a girlfriend or something like that still had few to no friends not the best of the years5th year good teachers yeah had 2 that year one of them would laugh a little at my silly jokes but still the same thing oh by the way blod girl 1 was back to my class kinda fell in love with her again but there were other girls that were as hot as her and still few to no friends my grades gradually fell this year at 89 years old i remember having spent nights crying thinking about killing myself also got my first computer this year and loved the gameboy advance emulator gunzthe duel and played the demo of dungeon siege so many times that i cant really remember6th year hard one went to live in another city since my mom decided to live with her boy friend but she had just joined college and would stay away most of the day well this time i would actually only see her at weekends stepdad wasnt so bad unless when he had to protect his daughter then everything was my fault x either way hell would describe my experience in this place not many friends i was cocky about my brain didnt really get good grades cuz wouldnt really focus on school my brotherinlaw left home during winter to live with his mom my stepdad was unbearable for him7th year even tougher 6 months after his son leaving stepdad would have his good days and hell days mom wouldnt really listen to me not htat i tried a lot but still my grades were kinda better i was starting to make friends kinda went thourhg a hell lot of situtations that year learned a lot met msn had a fake email and account where i would trick horny grown up lesbians into sending me erotic vids nudes and showing themselves on webcam also used to join uols chat and fake myself into someone else apparently i was really good at that since i got a fair ammount of friends this way 8th year bad year back to the starting city the one where i was born and back to old school everyone had grown bonds and all that i came back as a strange everything was different and i felt really out of place made a few friends though i was still playing the duel though whenever i had internet almost never lost contact with everyone that i had on msn before bad thing cuz i was starting to discover that i could be quite appealing as myself if i didnt show my face kinda made a girl fall in love with me just kinda but was enough to fell a little good about myself and enough to feel that someday someone would love me indeed by who i am not just cuz i was family or we at this point i was already alone at home my bedroom was the only room in my floor and no one would go there oftenly loved the peace hated the loneliness my sister would occasionaly go there and make me company too bad we werent very close i liked her 9th year my sisterinlaw went away to live with her mom so i was completely lonely 100 untill i met people from 1 grade below started talking to them fell in love and at the end of the year i kissed her curious fact i dated her for 2 weeks before kissing her she went to live in another city at the end of the year oh and there were these girls that were really friendly to me during the year we kinda became best friends good old times oh and in an arts class someone saw the volume of my dick in through my pants and i got a big dick kind of fame hell yeah that year was feeling good could i say it was the best year in my life hell yeah it was also i started to play wonderland online good game lots of people from everywhere but brazil to talk with thats when i learned english for real also i discovered my dad would live and work besides my school basically got very sad about that kinda started somewhat of a friendship with him 1st yearhighschool kept dating through internet my girlfriend from last year lasted exactly 1 year a couple hour less actually i kinda of cheated on her after she went missing for a long time i said kinda cuz it was through sexting with a girl from somewhere in europe lithuania maybe could be a guy also who knows either way got a good ammount of friends in game didnt need irl friends anymore also after all all of them were just annyoing at this point most of them werent inteligent enough to keep an interesting conversation wouldnt know a thing about games anime computer or anything like this they basically liked big brother and other erm nor very interesting programs also tv was their main source of entertainment i was into computer a lot more had a few internet friends at the end when my girlfriend broke up with me kinda felt depressive though i started playing volleyball somewhere in this year2nd year although i was depressive i learned that if i wanna feel better i just need someone to get naked to me so i got a web girlfriend from an asian country she was 10 years old but was deeply in love with me as i was with her or so i thought we started dating somewhere between 2nd and 3rd year and we got along very well not much to talk about school i just ignored it mostly oh by the way i was playing volleyball this year and thats the end of it also3rd year now this was a strange year i was already kind of fluent at english and i had finnished the englishcourse outside school school offered extra classes for the admission test for collegeif you wanna get in a college here you have to do this test and your grades during elementary to highschool means absolutely nothing and i took it most of the time i ignored it though also i started some dancing classes

followed me untill i went to college the bullying no the shitting myself part that stopped somewhere before 5th year so uhm i will not talk about the bullying part here i dont want to wouldnt feel right so expect random cut offs and subjects those will be to run from the bullying subject okay so where was i oh yeah well i was kind of smart though so thats a plus kinda cuz i was way too talkative also and would run through all the class untill everyone would scold me and yell at me and all that well i just have always liked to play and since the subjects were kind of way too easy lol so i had nothing to focus on well lame excuese i get it but still that was me so uhm something else happenned at that time mommy got a boyfriend this big huge tall faaaaat boyfriend nice guy though rude as rock but nice i think uhm well he had 2 kids so i kinda got a brother and a sister i think that you would call the my brotherinlaw and sisterinlaw well we do not have a word for that here so they were them we would see each other every weekend once at my home once at their home untill 5thyear of elementary school oh by the way lemme tell who i used to live with momwould work all day usually we wouldnt see each other much as she usually would get home late and leave very early in the morning to work but weekends were great and she was the most absolutely gorgeous beautiful woman still when we would fight she had this anger inside against me as if she hheld some hatred towards me deep inside her because i was her exhusbands son but when we were not fighting she has always been the best grandmatakes care of her home untill today can barely walk without feeling pain in her ankles but would walk a thousand miles as long as there is some shop with well anything from clothes to house decoration but mainly shirts grandpaused to work a lot in an industryas a guard during the night and sleep during the afternoon later on he used to take kids to school on his kombiyup he had a school kombi certified and everything very funny caring and but wouldnt want to make him angry and last uncleoh uncle might write a whole sotry just about how he made my life hell not directly or willingly but still made it hell every morning he and grandma would argue about his religion or about what he wanted to eat or about his dick size or about how his chest was sunken in the middle yeah strange topics and i would listen to that everyday yeeah every single day annoying but i ended up getting used to it a videogamerpg addicted only good thing he gave mebesides the fact that once he looked at me and during an arguemente with my grandma he said that i didnt need to worry cuz my dick definitely would have a good size cuz my dads dick also had a goold size i had like 7 or 8 years oldwell these are the people that lived with me so uhm i had a few friends at the townhouse there were 10 buildings ifi am not mistaken so there were the summer friends those that would appear only in summer and the year long friends that would stay throughout the year there were a few and and whole lot lot of stories that are quite funny and interesting but none really important for this so lemme make the 2nd to 4th years quick2nd year i remember absolutely nothing besides shitting myself and everyone laughing at me thats it besides having the best grades of the class and being talkative as hell to whoever sit besides me wether they liked it or not though but of course this wasnt nice3rd year good teacher i fell in love with this blond girl that everyone else was in love with i had no chance and i felt really bad about that i still had the best grades kinda become the classs clown to try and make friends didnt work at all talked to mom about not having friends she argued with someone at school that wnet to class and kinda ordered other kids to make friends with me i felt like shit and learned that i should not talk to my mom about this otherwise id be only more embarrasesed about that at 6 to 7 years old my problems with friends would have to be my own and not anyone elses 4th year good teacher i fell in love with this other blond girl that everyone else fell in love also i still had no chance and felt even worse about that i still had the best grades had a rival that year good guy really funny not smart at all he failed completely that year also but he had a girlfriend or something like that still had few to no friends not the best of the years5th year good teachers yeah had 2 that year one of them would laugh a little at my silly jokes but still the same thing oh by the way blod girl 1 was back to my class kinda fell in love with her again but there were other girls that were as hot as her and still few to no friends my grades gradually fell this year at 89 years old i remember having spent nights crying thinking about killing myself also got my first computer this year and loved the gameboy advance emulator gunzthe duel and played the demo of dungeon siege so many times that i cant really remember6th year hard one went to live in another city since my mom decided to live with her boy friend but she had just joined college and would stay away most of the day well this time i would actually only see her at weekends stepdad wasnt so bad unless when he had to protect his daughter then everything was my fault x either way hell would describe my experience in this place not many friends i was cocky about my brain didnt really get good grades cuz wouldnt really focus on school my brotherinlaw left home during winter to live with his mom my stepdad was unbearable for him7th year even tougher 6 months after his son leaving stepdad would have his good days and hell days mom wouldnt really listen to me not htat i tried a lot but still my grades were kinda better i was starting to make friends kinda went thourhg a hell lot of situtations that year learned a lot met msn had a fake email and account where i would trick horny grown up lesbians into sending me erotic vids nudes and showing themselves on webcam also used to join uols chat and fake myself into someone else apparently i was really good at that since i got a fair ammount of friends this way 8th year bad year back to the starting city the one where i was born and back to old school everyone had grown bonds and all that i came back as a strange everything was different and i felt really out of place made a few friends though i was still playing the duel though whenever i had internet almost never lost contact with everyone that i had on msn before bad thing cuz i was starting to discover that i could be quite appealing as myself if i didnt show my face kinda made a girl fall in love with me just kinda but was enough to fell a little good about myself and enough to feel that someday someone would love me indeed by who i am not just cuz i was family or we at this point i was already alone at home my bedroom was the only room in my floor and no one would go there oftenly loved the peace hated the loneliness my sister would occasionaly go there and make me company too bad we werent very close i liked her 9th year my sisterinlaw went away to live with her mom so i was completely lonely 100 untill i met people from 1 grade below started talking to them fell in love and at the end of the year i kissed her curious fact i dated her for 2 weeks before kissing her she went to live in another city at the end of the year oh and there were these girls that were really friendly to me during the year we kinda became best friends good old times oh and in an arts class someone saw the volume of my dick in through my pants and i got a big dick kind of fame hell yeah that year was feeling good could i say it was the best year in my life hell yeah it was also i started to play wonderland online good game lots of people from everywhere but brazil to talk with thats when i learned english for real also i discovered my dad would live and work besides my school basically got very sad about that kinda started somewhat of a friendship with him 1st yearhighschool kept dating through internet my girlfriend from last year lasted exactly 1

a guy also who knows either way got a good ammount of friends in game didnt need irl friends anymore also after all all of them were just annyoing at this point most of them werent inteligent enough to keep an interesting conversation wouldnt know a thing about games anime computer or anything like this they basically liked big brother and other erm nor very interesting programs also tv was their main source of entertainment i was into computer a lot more had a few internet friends at the end when my girlfriend broke up with me kinda felt depressive though i started playing volleyball somewhere in this year2nd year although i was depressive i learned that if i wanna feel better i just need someone to get naked to me so i got a web girlfriend from an asian country she was 10 years old but was deeply in love with me as i was with her or so i thought we started dating somewhere between 2nd and 3rd year and we got along very well not much to talk about school i just ignored it

to really deeply care about anyone becausei am so dead and cold inside that there is no point all i do is go to work and class eat which i cant even enjoy as much anymore as ive had so many god damn gastrointestinal problems recently i cant even be comforted by it anymore and go to bed i cant afford psychiatric help so i am and always have been on my own the very few people ive ever had a somewhat real conversation with have dismissed me as being melodramatic and depressing always a great thing to hear and i havent even bothered to be really open with themi am an american but a lot of family lives abroad and i have to work very hard to send money back there because they need it which at this point is the only thing that gives me some sense of fulfillment because it gives me the false sense that someone needs me even though they only need me for the financial aspect if i disappeared the only loss anyone would experience would be my paychecks and oh boy does that cut deep in every other aspecti amuseless and unnecessary i drink pretty often which i know doesnt help but its the only thing that makes me feel good if i go out thats always going to be a good way to do it i dont even want to feel sorry for myself but i dont want to feel this way anymore and theres no sign of a resolution to it i want to die so very much and i have so many ways i can do it but i am not doing it yet for some unidentifiable reason but i dont know how long that unidentifiable force will be here\n\nQuestion: Does this post indicate suicidal intentions?

does and i just take them becausei amthe worst person on the planet so i guess i will start with the reasons i thinki am so depressed when i was 16 i had what i thought was the perfect life with the perfect parents until the day my dad left my mom it was totally unwarranted i even remember me and my sisters laughing at him because we thought it was a joke not a joke fast forward to now i found out he had been cheating on my mom for 6 years my mom knew nothing my parents friends decided to leave her in the dark till after the divorce was final being sixteen and going through that was hell for me i remember trying to cut myself but i was too scared to cut too deep all i ended up with were little cat scratches on my wrist real edgy anyways so ive also been in love with someone for eh 9 years the problem being this person lives in a different country he had no intention of moving to the statescant say i blame him and to be honest if i were to move there i dont think he would want a relationship with me even though we talk frequently he tells me loves me from time to time but thats easy to say when you know youll never actually have to deal with the consequences of telling someone that so just about every yeartwo years i skip from relationship to relationship i think so i dont get attached i dk but its really hard on me mentally and its even harder because i dont truly understand why i do itokay so fast forward to last december i found out i was pregnant it was a weird feeling i was so overjoyed i think because i thought it would give me purpose i had just started a

back asleep i was getting up and around for work at 6 and i was spotting so i called into work i told them i thought it was an ovarian cyst when i got to the hospital everyone was really nicei think they already knew what was going on fast forward to getting an ultra sound and sitting there waiting 5 hours i found out that the fetus inside me was dead who knows how long i had been carrying that thing inside of me dead they gave me my options and i told them i would think about them make a few calls to my insurance provider and let them know tomorrow they sent me on my way at 6pm that night i

afraid of death i could put a gun to my head and pull the trigger right now the other problem is that i am an empath and i know killing myself would hurt a lot of people its not their fault they dont
