{"original_text":"I'm tired of everything. I feel like a calamity, everything I touch goes bad. My entire life is a shitshow. I was raped multiple times by my own cousin when I was younger. Couldn't tell my parents due to fear of being abandoned and not being believed. Now that my parents know, they still appease the rapist's parents wothout any care for me. They tell me to forget what happened.\n\n I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and cptsd. Therapy is kicking my ass as I'm focusing on trauma.\n\n I was emotionally neglected by my family. My friends in school told me that nobody wants me around and I should go away. I was alone and without any friends after they left me for 3 years. Trusting anyone is still so difficult for me. \n\nI'm being forced into arranged marriage by my parents because according to them, they will die sooner or later and I will be left alone my entire life. I tried speaking to someone but got rejected because I'm mentally sick and have to take medication for it. I like someone whom I can't be with due to distance.

has told her he loves her and wants to marry her i am not naive to think he really loves her the idiot just cant tell the difference between love and infatuation regardless hes still a happy idiot and i ammiserablesoi am going through the process of grieving i went crazy and was very close to killing myself the only reason i didnt is because of my familyi amgetting better ive had moments where ive accepted it and am ready to move on but the thing is i think this is the besti amgonna be until i find someone else like this is basically how i was before i met him just pretty apathetic about lifei amstarting to make friends and trying to better myself but for what so i can force myself to tolerate this life so i dont kill myself to keep other people happyi am in law school and i am trying to focus on the material and do the readings but i amfalling behind because i just dont care anymore i have to force myself to do this so i can get a job to support myself one day so i can tolerate this life sweetyeah maybe i will meet someone else one day that makes me feel happy like my ex did but what happens when he leaves too like my ex almost proposed to me everyone in my family loved him i thought everything was great between us then bam hes fallen out of love with me like fuck how am i supposed to trust after that and whats shittier is that i still miss him i tell myself over and over

person and feel happy of course theres fights and its not always roses but even the shitty times with him are better than these apathetic moments life felt like it had purpose now it feels like theres no point now its just me surviving and putting on a smile so other people arent sad which i mean i get it itd be selfish of me to trade my apathy for their sadness but this isnt fulfilling this is just being another number in the world i wish i just never existed that way no one could be sad over me because they never would have known me and i wouldnt hurt because i never would have known what life is i wish i wouldnt have screwed things up with him yeah he didnt buy me presents or do things that i wanted to do and thats shitty that makes me a pushover and pathetic but i was still happier

enough for suicide for some people but unfortunately my misfortunes sadly dont end there as i also have a condition called pectus carinatum which is a chest deformity which causes the sternum to be pushed out in a very visible way which has done a great deal to my self esteem i can assure you since the age of 1314 these conditions both howether pale in the suffering caused by this third curse in which i have obtained huge terrible looking scars that i have ever seen even with the searching on the internet which cover at least 55 of my penis from the base to the tip in which i have absolutely no recollection of its emergence into my life which is a nice mystery for me to investigate in my spare time along with a lifetime of bullying in school for my racebodyshoeswealth and name by children and certain teachers alike i have also been persecuted all my life by my mother who also had blamed me for the abandonment of my father at the age of 7 directly to my face a memory i would like to forget if possible and of course my gambling addiction had manifested itself in order to perhaps accumulate wealth in order to try plaster the abyss known as my self worth bu unfortunately has only concluded in a loss of thousands of pounds and has not been as helpful as i had once thought i am also 19 years of age btw and i apologise for the wording and structure of this writing asi amkinda not

year i had a very intense fight with my mom she was listening in on me telling my boss that i need a break from work because of my mental health problems my goal was to end my life after that fight but i still dont believe it was an attempt i cant wrap my head around the fact i did attempt suicide because nothing happened i didnt end up unconscious or anything from the half of bottle of pills that i took i could hear my mom saying she wanted to kill herself and my dad telling her to put down the knife i snapped out of whatever mental break i had when i took the pills and i told my dad what i did he drove me to the hospital afterward i was treated evaluated and was voluntarily committed to another mental hospital for 2 weeks the treatment i received worked for some time but my depression came back around june my suicidal thoughts started in july and i have been cutting again to cope my family isnt exactly supportive i have an older brother who has problems too but he is basically verbally abusive towards my mom and i he will call me anal whore slut and use christianity to put me down hes not even a christian i am not comfortable dating or having relationships so i dont at all he constantly brings up the one and only guy i went out with a few years ago to tell mei amforever his bitch he would text me offensive and creepy things before i started forwarding his texts to the rest of my family they wont do anything he is literally a troll he will constantly say the exboyfriends name or call me a bitch if my parents arent around he would make kissing noises and faces at me if i was around or drive by him he has said unprovoked that i should kill myself after i was out of the hospital he cant keep any job and lacks any kind of common sense or respect he will act like a crazy jerk in our house but he will quickly act normal if he is outside of our neighborhood my dad tells me to ignore him but how do you ignore something like that he wont bother or threaten my father or other brothers he is about 6 and my mom and i are under 52 he has smacked my mom in the face before and i have gotten into physical altercations with him as well my dad is usually there to stop them but he doesnt have much authority ever since the police told my father the owner of the house can kick my brother out hes stopped caring because its my mothers responsibility they keep allowing him to come back i dont feel safe in my house or in my neighborhood anymore the boy and i use to ignore each other if we ever cross paths but he now makes it a point to harass me even outside i am constantly looking over my shoulder he has even attempted to walk in the middle of the road if he sees me driving down the street and he will do something obnoxious when i drive by him anyway my mom

my mom no power i literally have nowhere else to go and i dont have a car i feel trapped i have a moderate to severe autoimmune disease and it can prevent me from going to work or school i feel like

physical altercations with him as well my dad is usually there to stop them but he doesnt have much authority ever since the police told my father the owner of the house can kick my brother out hes stopped caring because its my mothers responsibility they keep allowing him to come back i dont feel safe in my house or in my neighborhood anymore the boy and i use to ignore each other if we ever cross paths but he now makes it a point to harass me even outside i am constantly looking over my shoulder he has even attempted to walk in the middle of the road if he sees me driving down the street and he will do something obnoxious when i drive by him anyway my mom will constantly say hes not normal but she allows him to continue living here she owns the house and i cant stand her enabling him my brother is aware of this and he has recently started shouting at my mom no power i literally have nowhere else to go and i dont have a car i feel trapped i have a moderate to severe autoimmune disease and it can prevent me from going to work or school i feel like between my depression disease shame and crappy family that i would be better off dead if he went away life wont be as depressing and i can effectively deal with my other personal issues more often i was already depressed before he started becoming a monster but it feels like there is no safe place to recover with him lurking in the house sorry for the long post thank you again for reading\n\nQuestion: Does this post indicate suicidal intentions?

{"original_text":"(edited with AI for length)\n\n I hit a new low recently and feared becoming homeless. My life has been tough, abusive parents, bad relationships, and constant financial struggles. I worked hard, avoided substance abuse, and did years of therapy, but stability always felt out of reach. Over 40 now, I\u2019ve had roommates most of my adult life due to bad credit and poor financial choices and mostly low income. \n\nLast summer, I thought I secured a stable job, only to be ghosted. I took a terrible job to survive, then struggled to get interviews because my tenure was too short. Political chaos made everything worse. I spiraled too much TV, mobile games, and self-hate while pretending I was fine. The final blow came when my boss fired me after I went to the ER for suicidal thoughts, I can't prove this is why I was fired. \n\nI nearly gave up, but something in me\u2014maybe pettiness, maybe resilience\u2014said to keep going. I used rubber bands instead of self-harm, rode out the dark days, and today, I got a job offer today that will help me get back on track, its stable and offers good money. I could\u2019ve missed this chance. I've had 3 interviews in 6 months and I finally got the one that mattered.\n\nI\u2019m not here to say life is always worth it. I know how deep the pain goes, but I\u2019ve realized I want to be better at handling setbacks. I want love, stability, and a future. Through the years of being broke I've figured out ways to make a better living for myself. Certificates to get, how to afford finishing college. Financial literacy is key. Emotional resilience is key and I don't want to give up on the life I envisioned for myself. And if you\u2019re struggling, I see you. My DMs are open.

past but they were always just thoughts i always knew i would never actually do it but in the past few weeks these suicidal thoughts have been much louder and theyre starting to sound more and more rational ive always been quiet and introverted i dont like talking to the people in my life about anything serious i just hide my depression behind thick layers of ironic humor and its fucked me up over the yearsi amcompletely lost and suicide sounds so fucking relaxing now knowing that i could just end all my problems and suffering so easily is such a comforting thoughti ama junior in

new peoplei ama business major so theres a lot of pressure to be active in activities and get experience to add to my resume so i can get an internship and look attractive to employers but i cant do any of that my social anxiety is so fucking strong how the hell am i supposed to get through life if i cant even do simple shit like talking to people life is supposed to be a healthy mix of doing things you enjoy and doing things you dont enjoy i know its not rational for a person to be happy all the time enjoying every moment theyre in but for me especially lately there are seldom moments where i findi amhappy the majority of my time is spent doing things i dont want to do i dont find joy in anything anymore nothing excites me nothing can motivate me i feel so disconnected from other people everything is so dull even the things that i used to really enjoy like sex for example is just so bland sex used to be the one thing that i had that i really enjoyed i used it to cope with my depression for the longest time but now thats turned dull just like everything else if i dont find anything enjoyable anymore then whats the point i genuinely cannot think of a reason to not kill myself theres no reward in life anymore why would i stick around its all just fucking shit and dealing with sadness and discomfort and anxiety all the time i so badly want to just not exist i dont

{"original_text":"sweating after surgery about 5 years ago i had a surgery called endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy ets this was meant to stop my palms and underarms from sweating before i had it i was told it was reversible because they were going to clip the nerve instead of cut it i wasnt told about any other side effects and i trusted the doctorssome time after the surgery i learned that many people experience what is known as compensatory sweating cs the sweating might stop in one area but now they sweat in another area it usually happens right away but sometimes it takes years before it starts i also learned that ets is irreversible even with the clips the damage to the nerves has been donefor 4 years i didnt experience any cs until this past year and it has made my life absolute hell i sweat profusely from my legs buttocks back and face i feel lied to and cheated by my doctors i wish i could go back before the surgery but now i will sweat all over my body for the rest of my life i never would have done this if i knew the risksi heard about drugs called anticholinergics which can stop the sweat but also stop other body secretions like saliva causing dry mouth and sore throat i tried those for a couple of weeks with some success but i then started to experience muscle twitches all over my body after searching i discovered muscle twitches are an unlisted side effect of anticholinergic use it has been about 4 months and i still experience almost constant muscle twitches despite stopping the meds when it started ive developed insomnia because i cant sleep due to the muscle twitchesat this point i feel like my life has been ruined and i am absolutely hopeless i cant have a normal relationship with anyone because of the stigma of being sweaty doctor here have no answer besides different anticholinergic drugs i am hesitant to try any of them at this point because i still twitch all over my body on the internet i found a doctor in taiwan that does a procedure to stop sweating specifically caused by this surgery but if i wanted to treat all of my body it would be over 100000 as someone unemployed who just finished college i cant even imagine paying for that or even finding any job at this pointive been to two psychologists and neither of them have been very helpful theyve essentially told me i have to deal with it nothing theyve said to help me cope has been of any use the second one said after explaining what happened that sucks which only made me more upseti probably would have killed myself by now if it wasnt for my parents and a slight hope something might make it tolerable i already had other bodyimage issues which have made me extremely depressed prior to cs starting ive talked to my mom about my problems and she made me promise that id keep trying to find something that helps i know if i died it would kill her as well she cares about her kids more than anything else she already suffers from depression due to her own medical problems that cause physical pain i love my mom too much to hurt her but its so difficult to keep going when nobody else understands i wish i never had this surgery doneif anyone actually took the time to read all of this thank you i appreciate it i had hoped writing down my experience and how i felt would make me feel better but i dont know if it really

everything fell apart i started developing a social anxiety one of the main reasons college sucked was because i started dating this girl who took up all my time she was very clingy and jealous and had depression and anxiety and would never let me go out ever or she would have a panic attack which would lead me to stay everytime i would even mention breaking up with her she would say something about her depression and suicide and it felt like there wasnt much i could do besides stay with her you know i felt trapped and i didnt know what to do for months this would happen and soon led me to being isolated from people on my dorm floor and any types of friends any time she was gone i would just stay in my room because my anxiety made it impossible for me to have the courage to go out and make friends i soon dropped out of college leading to a strained relationship with my parents that hasnt been fixed and finally got the courage to break up with my gf which soon led her to try and kill herself which was the worst day of my life i have always wanted to make people happy and to think that someone wanted to kill themself because of me really took a toll on me i got into some fucked up thoughts i kept thinking if i were not around people would be happier like maybe if i wasnt around my gf would not have tried to kill herself my mom would not be dissapointed in her college drop out son and every single time i messed up especially when i messed up on the job waiting tables i felt like all i did was make people lives worst i started drinking a lot more and started having many suicidal thoughts myself nowi am20 years old who just moved to a new college trying to start over and forget my past but the thing is my past is something that will always be a part of me my anxiety has worsen and i cant help but think that everyone hates me and thinksi ama loser i spend every night in my room watching youtube and will spend days at a time without saying a wordi amjust very unhappy right now and i feel like no one cares about me anymore i dont why i decided to write this and i dont even know if it makes sense but i guess i just need advice from anyone who has gone through something similar i just want my life to go back to normal i dont know if i posted this in the right subreddit but there you go\n\nQuestion: Does this post indicate suicidal intentions?

before i turn 40my friends are all married and having children i am meanwhile trudging along trying to make new friends and stay involved in something outside of work i go to the gym a lot i read i have hobbies i travel i even moved across the country i can improve lots of things about my life i am a proud person and i am not helpless still i have no close friends that understand me and want to hear about what i am going through if i even hint at being depressed i get the old chin up tough guy or people just stop calling i also have very bad relationships with my family i have one sibling and we will probably never speak again not close with my parents i had one serious girlfriend but we broke up years ago and i have not tried a serious relationship since then lots of flings and short term dating but nothing serious and i dont think i could ever be in a relationship againi just cannot fathom a reason to keep living other than sheer momentum and the will to live i rarely experience any joy i just work either at my actual job or on hobbies and side projects i am constantly working the thing is i like working it gives me a purpose otherwise i feel like life is pointless i have to make something out of my life what else is there to do when you are my age dating is like torture to me everyone i meet on a dating site is just looking for someone to buy them dinner and drinks and show them a good time i feel objectified and i never feel a connection sex is meaningless sensory stimulation i enjoy it on a primal level but it leaves me feeling empty the only thing i can offer women is sex or the superficial stability that women in their 30s want basically to have a house and a car the trappings of a successful life but that isnt what i want i want to live a real life i want somebody who likes books and doesnt care about bullshit i have almost completely given up on women at this pointi am tired of getting burned and i dont want to date anyone i dont have a connection withmy sole hope in life is to somehow make that connection otherwise i think i am doomed to a life of working and striving for no reason for decades and decades until i am too old to work and i become useless i can keep plucking away at some of my goals for the rest of my life and maybe make some casual acquaintances friendly neighbors etc but am i so crazy to think this isnt good enough what is the point of becoming really smart and strong and talented and wealthy and amazing if there is no one else around and its just you in a room alonei dont want that to happen to me so i

ruling out shit like brain tumors and thought i was having seizurescollege sucked i chose poorly and wasnt ready i did a yeari am still on leave i know i will never be able to afford to go backi am not sure that i want to up until thursday i didnt think i would have to because this summer after all of the bullshit the shit jobs the loneliness and everything else i managed to actually get the job i really wanted and then i went and somehow found a way to fuck it up actually no thats a lie i know exactly how i fucked it up by being myselfim not sure whats left at this point my entire life has been about making it to the next place because that wont suck right only it just seems to get more lonely and miserable no matter how hard i try i dont have dreams for the future anymore when people ask me where i seem myself in ten yearsi amcompletely lost because i cant imagine even being alive in ten years its not that i plan on being dead its that i dont see howi am going to make iti amjust

hungused an exit bag yet even though i have all of the materialsi am17 male and pathetic i would tell you guys why but its kind of complicated and i think i explained it pretty well in my other posts you could check them out on my profile if youd likebasicallyi ampurposely sabotaging everything i have its a form of self punishmentphysical sabotage i used to workout but ever since i had a mental breakdown about sports and weightlifting i have been eating just enough to survive i do this to lose almost all my muscle mass and athleticism for example used to have 34 standing vertical jump but now it is about 24 by an extreme caloric deficit i am working on becoming severely underweight malnourished and very weak to the point that walking is a chore basically imagine a skeleton with hair i have not been drinking much water either and am trying to stay in a steady state of dehydration again drinking just enough to stay alive i never exercise and force myself for example to take the elevator instead of stairs i know i am extremely lucky and fortunate to have a family that cares and access to all basic necessities but i reject them all i knowi amselfish and uncaring for doing these things but this is how much i hate myself ive even though about getting rid of an arm or leg by making a deep gash into my skin then exposing the gash to infectious diseases this would hopefully cause amputations i still take showers and brush my teeth because i hate being a nuisance to other people by smelling or something otherwise my body is a complete mess rightfully sofinancial sabotage

seems like somewhat of a cathartic experience ya know full circle type of shit i can t say i ve lived a hard or troubled life i never went without or experienced struggle the likes that a great majority have i went to a good school got good grades had plenty of extracurriculars and got into a great college on scholarship which i proceeded to flunk out of because i never showed up to class the problem is or rather my problem is that i ve never given a shit about anything in life ever that last sentence isn t entirely true i guess if i have to put it into words my life s goal has never been to improve or change anything or anyone s life it s been to be a net zero it was always easier to do well because no one would hassle me i like the easy way out even if it means a little bit of workweird rationalization i know i want to fade into nothingness i don t want to be remembered i don t want any trace of my life to ever exist at this point in my life i d rather be dead than to drag those around me down with my carefree wanton lifestyle because it s probably depressing for others to watch my life implode by my own hand to those wondering about mental health shit i m not depressed i kind of have an awesome life i do have schizophrenia or rather i was diagnosed with it though i haven t taken medication in over 8 months as i ve had no signs or inklings of it schizophrenia was freaky at first and to be honest i flipped the fuck out straight 5150 status but once i understood what was going on in my head the shit was easy to rationalize compartmentalize and control aside from some legal trouble ie alcohol related due to poor impulse control because yea i want to die my life is pretty dope life seems like a colossal waste of time that only drudges on to make me feel even worse about the shit i ve done the people i ve disappointed and the relationships i ve ruined via utter apathy maybe this isn t the right place to express my feelings but as much as i would love to commit suicide it s too much work for nothing i gain nothing by killing myself other than reliving the burden that being part of a society entails call me greedy selfish shortsighted or whatever you want but life has no meaning to me aside from suffering we all will die someday unless there are cyborgs so what s wrong with speeding the hands of father time up a bit i m but one drop in the bucket out of over six billion who cares life is cruel sadistic joke i guess the greeks had it right about sisyphus i don t know whether it s right to continue living a tortured existence where i m only bound to cause more long term hurt to those around me or in one swift action cause immediate pain that will subside over time i feel like a cancer to those around me i m at an impasse somewhat wishing i was standing on an overpass except knowing my luck i d land on a prius","cleaned_text":"death sounds pretty nice to me 25m suicide or rather death is nice dream to me i guess since i grew up going

much i understand her life wasn t that great either she started doing drugs and hanging out with iffy people and leaving me i m iffy people s care she started dating a guy on and off for almost nine years who was a registered sex offender and as a result i got taken away by cps quite a few times one of the people she left me with was a family friend who ended up molesting me when i was about ten we moved around a bit and i stayed with family members or family friends whenever i was taken away when i was about 12 we settled in one place finally and my dad was released out of prison on good behavior when i was 14 i started dating my best friend and came out to my mother that i was gay which she accepted my dad did not and to this day sends me religious things telling me to repent before i go to hell my sisters who are much older and who i m not very close with have always been iffy on it for example i wasn t allowed to bring my then fianc e over last christmas because of it high school was an iffy time as well my relationship wasn t stable as my girlfriend had loads of mental problems and baggage as well i ended up breaking up with her after some problems and i treated her like absolute shit along with most of my friends life had handed me a bad hand and i was angry about it and took it out on the people i cared about which was shitty i dated a new girl who broke up with my my senior year and caused me to go into a worse depression i got back with my ex and we dated until now my sophomore year in college i even proposed last year and we had plans on getting

rehabi amcurrently a 16 year old female living with a foster family my moms parental rights have been terminated and i am now essentially property of the state this whole issue has lead to chronic depression throughout my life now a days i just want to die and wish i wasnt born i spend most of my time on the computer wasting what would probably be the best years of my life i play a pretty small mmo like 100 active people that people like me on made some friends and had some relationships on it but nothing seems to be enough for me in real life i am made fun of for being poor foster parents optimize profits by buying clothes from good will and having the maximum amount of children in the house which is 8 in my state again theres no one i would really call a friend some people are nice to me and thats about it it just feels like nothing is enough thati amalways lonely and feel unloved unwanted and just tolerated i can never keep friends or friends group something happens usually small that hurts my feelings like not getting invited to do something or not being told information i get mad or upset and this stuff happens fairly often i think this damages my connections to people online which brings up a question i can never get people to answer if i am offended or hurt from something small and they dont see what it is experience from years of friends groups is it their fault

like its just an attempt for attentions like they would think wow you want to kill yourself because we didnt invite you and you can say they aint your real friends if they think that but its me thinking this i dont want to live i cant stop feeling this way i cant stop clinging to a random person that ends up being a dick and hurting me i cant stop losing friends i went to the woods earlier

about this stuff it seems like its just an attempt for attentions like they would think wow you want to kill yourself because we didnt invite you and you can say they aint your real friends if they think that but its me thinking this i dont want to live i cant stop feeling this way i cant stop clinging to a random person that ends up being a dick and hurting me i cant stop losing friends i went to the woods earlier to look for trees to hang myself from guess you guys and me writing this as a therapy tool are the only people that can try to helpedit issues probably are from trying to find someone to love me like a parent should","label":1,"source":"twitter","deepseek_prompt":"Post: fucked up foster kid didnt really know what to title this or where to start i guess i will start about my past so you can understand whyi am so fucked up now i dont know my birth father my step father not married and mother were drug addicts used to beat and neglect me i stayed with them until i was 12 and played into foster care with my step father in jail and my mother in rehabi amcurrently a 16 year old female living with a foster family my moms parental rights have been terminated and i am now essentially property of the state this whole issue has lead to chronic depression throughout my life now a days i just want to die and wish i wasnt born i spend most of my time on the computer wasting what would probably be the best years of my life i play a pretty small mmo like 100 active people that people like me on made some friends and had some relationships on it but nothing seems to be enough for me in real life i am made fun of for being poor foster parents optimize profits by buying clothes from good will and having the maximum amount of children in the house which is 8 in my state again theres no one i would really call a friend some people are nice to me and thats about it it just feels like nothing is enough thati amalways lonely and feel unloved unwanted and just tolerated i can never keep friends or friends group something happens usually small that hurts my feelings like not getting invited to do something or not being told information i get mad or upset and this stuff happens fairly often i think this damages my connections to people online which brings up a question i can never get people to answer if i am offended or hurt from something small and they dont see what it is experience from years of friends groups is it their fault or my fault like i am fucked up mentally so should i feel bad for feeling this way likei ambroken someway that i feel

{"original_text":"its all downhill from here long i went to one of the best high schools in my state i got okay grades made some friends and generally just tried to get through school unnoticed i was depressed for most of high school but i never had any suicidal ideations just selfharm i went to a local college where i was going to study engineering it wasnt my first choice since stem subjects arent my specialty but it was what my parents suggested so i went with it i did poorly in my first semester and had a few suicide attempts i stood on a balcony of a tenstory building several times but never got the nerve to jump when i came home for christmas my parents were mad at me for hiding my poor grades from them and i became even more depressed i stayed in bed most days during the spring semester and ended up trying to overdose in april i panicked and called 911 ending up in a psychiatric hospital it was a shitty place and i hope to never go there again my parents found out about my suicide attempt and i told them about my depression so they decided to send me to a therapistpsychiatrist they werent very helpful but i got some meds that at least helped me get out of bed i went back to school in the fall for accounting which my counselor recommended i try after taking an aptitude test school went just as poorly as it had previously though and it was a repeat of last years christmas break i went back to school in the spring but did poorly again this summer i got a customer service job and dropped out of college ever since ive been lying to my friends and convincing themi am still at college even though they never see me on campusif you bothered to read that whole story youve probably noticed a pattern in my life of things getting worse i was always told i could do great things but here i am at 20 going to work at a grocery store at 5 am i dont see my life getting better from here so i only see two possible futures one is where i live out the rest of my life working crappy jobs and leeching off of other people i disappoint everyone around me for decades until eventually i die miserable and alone alternately i kill myself now those closest to me will probably suffer a bit mourn for a little while but eventually theyll move on their lives will continue without me as a burden on them i will be free from worrying about the future and having to deal with my mistakes one of these futures is much more enticing than the other and i amrunning out of reasons not to choose the latter just looking for some outside opinions on what i should dotldr my life is awful and its easier to die now than live in suffering for decades so why not just end it","cleaned_text":"its all downhill from here long i went to one of the best high schools in my state i

is better off without me and i shouldnt burden them with my continued existencei amyounger i will admit but i am still legally an adult and in the end its my choice this is my only choice i cant

depression i guess both of our fatal flaws were never seeing a therapist we always figured we could help each other through our mental health we never really took our mental illnesses out on each othertwo months ago i had an ugly jealous feeling in my gut to check the messages he had a year ago with a mutual friend of ours jane he had a thing with her before he and i met and for the first part of our relationship she was really friendly with me and him but something always felt off to me i did what i d never done before and read his messages with her found out for the first 4 months of our relationship he was basically cheating on me with jane asking her to come over for netflix and chill saying i love you complimenting her saying but i m not a cheater though lol in the same conversation they would then talk about how great i was total brainfuckafter reading that i went on a drive this was the first time i had ever felt angry at him i called my best friend hysterical saying how much i hated him and i just wanted to die she talked me down and about an hour and a half later i come home my nowex realizes i read his messages and responds to my tears with a scoff asking why i m making such a big deal out of something that happened so long ago i break down crying because i had been cheated on in a very similar situation in my last relationship he then breaks down crying about how he doesn t deserve medoesn t understand why i m with him etc i spend the rest of the night reassuring him that i m not going to leave that he isn t a bad boyfriend that i need time but i can forgive him etci guess that was the start of the endhe went from fulltime to parttime in the job he was doing extremely well at i advised against it but it wasn t my call to make and we could pay bills just fine if he went to parttime shortly after i noticed him slipping into a depressive spiral he d drink beer and play league of legends literally any moment he wasn t at work i d wake up he s playing league get back from the gym he s playing league make breakfast he s still playing league come home from work he s still playing league just with two empty bottles of booze next to him now i figured this was all just depression and i needed to let him cope so i d sit on his lap while he d play video games ask him if he s winning kiss him on the cheek whatever then the day would end we d have sex all good rightthe last month has been hell i had felt completely neglected and like i was just an annoyance to him i beat myself up so much on the inside that my anorexic tendencies started coming back my seizure disorder came back full swing there was one instance where i was so disoriented i threw up in the bed all over the sheets myself and my hair then passed out i woke up and he was sleeping on the floor while i m still covered in puke that had been sitting for 6 hours when he went to work i had to drag myself out of bed shower off puke sitting down i couldn t even stand and hose off our sheets before running out the door to work the fact he didn t even offer to help should have been a sign that he just didn t care anymorei would sit down with him often and ask how he was he always said he was fine just needed to decompress several times i was crying asking him why i felt like i annoyed him every time i talked to him and what i could do differently nothing ever changedso during that month i was hardly eating going to the gym getting a seizure every other week and still doing all the housework cooking cleaning laundry it was exhausting i dropped out today but at the time i was still a full time college student and working full time he just had a part time job and wouldn t do anything around the house to helpmy full time job has also been shitty but it provided us a place to live weird housing situation so i m sure hating my full time job and having all the stress of full time college too just made it worse but i had no other choice if i didn t work there full time there was nowhere for us to live end of storythe day he left i had another talk with him we had plans to move to another state soon so i can finish my degree at a school i ve been excited to attend which is also by his hometown i think i scared him by giving him an ultimatum and saying i wasn t sure how things are going to work if it continues like this i couldn t keep doing literally everything on top of full time work and school and my declining health he got a really weird look in his eyes and said i know i need to make some changes that night i come home

{"original_text":"idk what to do anymore sorry for the long post i just typed what came to mind i m currently 23 and a half years old living in the netherlands when i was 16 i was diagnosed with high sensitivity and depression things that happen hit harder and stick longer in my brain both positively and negatively mostly the negative things though since my 16th birthday i ve had a psychologisti know right lovely birthday present until last year when i thought i had my life under control but apparently i ve just hit rock bottom when i was 15 i had my first girlfriend she had some problems of her own but i didn t think much about it because at that time i was busier with getting bullied and sitting behind my computer playing video games couple of months later she moved in with me and my mother i don t really know the reason anymore but there were some problems at her home it seemed like a good idea and it was kind of enjoyable for the first couple of weeks we shared a room and you know were teenagers raging with hormones after the said couple of weeks i kind of lost interest in the sexual things but still loved her nonetheless she began to change waking me up with sex while i didn t feel like it but i couldn t say anything about it because i thought it was normal my daily life consisted of waking up playing video games going to school coming back home and eating dinner crawl behind the computer chit chat with my ex talkingwatching tv if she wanted to do something or almost fall asleep behind the computer and go to bed occasionally someone that i knew messaged me or dragged me out of the house to get something to drink the owner of the caf she took me to knew my family so sometimes he would give me a couple of beers got a little out of my shell and went back home again every time i started talking to my ex that i wasn t feeling very happy and that i needed time for myself she threatened to commit suicide so i kept quiet my ex began to change again more sex i couldn t talk to people anymore she even got pissed at me when i talked to other people or even my mom didn t really know how to deal with it all around that time but i kind of held onto her annoyances and got annoyed as well due to my high sensitivity people around me couldn t see it but it was chipping away on the inside bullying continued at school and even at home i wouldn t feel comfortable anymore months later i snapped and ended up in some youth prison i blacked out broke a couple of windows and screamed at people and threatened my sister and my mother when it all happened when i try to remember it all again it s all foggy and i get a massive headache even to this day after a couple of weeks in youth prison i decided i had to get rid of my ex because she was negatively impacting my life i didn t care about her life anymore because i needed to fix my stuff first if i wanted to continue living she agreed packed her stuff and two days later had a new boyfriend i got over it but my daily life continued with gaming school and my courtassigned psychologist i discovered that i was depressed didn t see life in colors i couldn t care less about the people around me and didn t even feel a connection with my family members no bond or anything as far as i was concerned i was living with strangers i got antidepressants after the first couple of talks and the dosage increased more and more after every couple of talks i had no will to live no reason to be alive i was just a small dot on a piece of paper after a lot of talks i kinda felt better i was getting good at some videogames and even ended up having a lan party and actually winning it felt really good to achieve something even though it felt i wasn t even that good i felt as if my team won and i was unnecessary i still put on a happy face for my team and the pictures that were getting taken but it wasn t me that helped the team to the first place it was the other four i started studying application developer not really having any clue why but it made me sit behind a computer the entire day and i learned new things so i couldn t complain it was a 4 year course but in my second year i lost interest and motivation again every teacher and fellow student told me i breezed through the classes and i could pick up things in an incredible pace but i couldn t get out of bed never hungry or felt the need to eat and i d cry myself to sleep for some reason i was still unhappy my psychologist called the school and talked to their therapist to set up a meeting with me to talk me through my issues so i could get my motivation back and continue because i was already halfway it didn t work out and i redid my 2nd year no luck felt even worse didn t make it my school talked me into downgrading the level so instead of an application developer i started studying to become an it guy all my older classmates finished school and i barely made it through the entrylevel course i started doing different kinds of work to get money slowly things looked a little brighter i had money i could do things myself i wasn t that much dependent on my mother and stepdad anymore and i even got lighter antidepressants i met a girl on someone else s birthday party a couple of months later and when i was intoxicated enough we made out and started hanging out we had a good thing going every weekend i went to her parents place to play videogames and talk about difficult things she had a lower back hernia and in secret i tried learning to give lowerback massages to people with hernias to relieve their pain a little but sadly i took over the negative trait of being to clingy from my previous ex and destroyed the only good thing i had in life i was devastated back to square minus 50 i started getting suicidal and they upped my meds again tried committing suicide 4 times and even when i almost jumped in front of a train someone pulled me off and not because he was a good person but because he didn t want to be late for work talk about a finishing blow i went back to focusing on work and getting money and years later i met someone else at the same job in that year my meds were taken away and i could handle it on my own we started dating and the talks with my psychologist ended it felt natural and trusting so i ended up opening up to her couple months later we had our own
