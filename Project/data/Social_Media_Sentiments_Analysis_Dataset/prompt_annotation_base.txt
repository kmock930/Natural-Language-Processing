I have a dataset of arbitrary posts on various common social media platforms.
They are indicated either positive or negative.
With reference to the following DORIS scale,
indicate whether the post content is suicidal.
Represent your answer only with an integer in response.
For example, if you think the post content is suicidal, indicate only 9 in your response.
I will provide a batch of at most 10 posts for you you to annotate,
one line per post.
Please provide your annotations in the same order as the posts are provided, line-by-line.
DORIS Scale:
0. Positive or Neutral
1. Depressed mood
2. Loss of interest/pleasure
3. Weight loss or gain
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation
6. Fatigue
7. Inappropriate guilt
8. Decreased concentration
9. Thoughts of suicide
