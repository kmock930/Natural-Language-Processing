I am struggling a lot financially trying to support my two kids. I may lose my house. I work full time and I do my best but it&amp;#39;s never enough. I made a whole plan today to get a huge life insurance policy. One that still pays out after unaliving, and I figure I just wait the year or so and then I will know they are well taken care of for the rest of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is better for them I think to have the structure of keeping their home and not having to worry about their next meal or clothes or anything. I promised myself they would never need for anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDK what else to do because I feel like that&amp;#39;s exactly what a good mother would do. Anything for their children. It&amp;#39;s my fault we are struggling. I left a very unhappy marriage almost a year ago. Selfishly. If I had stayed there they wouldn&amp;#39;t need anything because my ex made good money. But when I left him, he left his job and now doesn&amp;#39;t pay almost anything for child support since he doesn&amp;#39;t work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was selfish and a bad mother. And now it&amp;#39;s my fault they may suffer. So it&amp;#39;s my job to make it right for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i got into a decent spot mentally, but then i moved back in with my mom. she has reminded me within a couple weeks who i really am. we never had a good relationship when i was growing up. she was going through a lot and i was the one who was more outspoken, so she took a lot of frustration out on me. i moved out at 18 but moved back in at 21. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she’s explained to me that i am verbally abusive; i bring stuff up from the past way too much, and hurt her feelings with things that she’s done in the past that she doesn’t remember doing (but i somehow remember every detail). she says that she’s known me for a long time, and i am not capable of doing certain things. the thing that hurts most is that she’s reminded me over and over that i’m the most selfish person she’s met because i don’t see other people’s perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you know what? she’s right. i’m not a good student, i’m not good at my job, im not a easy person to get along with. i don’t have any hobbies that im especially good at. i don’t have any friends. i have my cat, but my mom says she takes better care of her than i do. i have nobody. if i disappeared, nobody would realize. as soon as i move out of here, i’ll literally have no family, no friends, nothing. there is nothing to keep me here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;no matter how good i try to be, i have never been. i’ll never be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t accurately describe to you how this inadequacy I feel every day is like. Without exaggerating; I am objectively ugly. That&amp;#39;s just the hard unfortunate reality for me. I am miserable because I know I cannot have/experience what others have. I&amp;#39;m 21 (M), and for the majority of my life could always tell I never quite compared to my contemporaries. It was in high school when I realized the problem was my appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My face is elongated and oval, my chin is recessed and downward grown, I have a flat maxilla, long /flat mid-face, rounded jaw, full and undefined cheeks, childish features, protruded bottom lip, protruding ears, high and broad forehead, my hair is thinning, my body is riddled in stretchmarks from obesity as a teenager, I am autistic, I have a speech impediment, I am below average height, and so is my phallus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried what I could the last few years to try to make myself appear attractive and self-acceptance, but you just can&amp;#39;t make me look good, and I just can&amp;#39;t accept this being my fate. I know there is more to life than looks, but a lot of it ties into looks. I can&amp;#39;t just go out and do the same as an attractive or average person and expect the same results. I haven&amp;#39;t experienced anything in my life because I can&amp;#39;t. I don&amp;#39;t know what some people don&amp;#39;t understand. I try, I try, and I try, and I can&amp;#39;t make anything happen.&lt;/p&gt;

Every day it hurts more and more. I&amp;#39;m mentally ill and there&amp;#39;s no cure for my disease. I&amp;#39;ve seen a million doctors and been on all kinds of antidepressants for almost 10 years and it only gets harder as time goes on. I just want my pain to end, but i can&amp;#39;t tell my family about my suicidal thoughts or my doctor. I don&amp;#39;t want to be taken away again and i don&amp;#39;t want to scare anyone, but i don&amp;#39;t want to hurt my mom either. I never had the best relationship with my family and i don&amp;#39;t want them to blame themselves because they did all that they could. I don&amp;#39;t know how much longer i can do this. I just want to sleep forever and never wake up. I don&amp;#39;t have a single friend and sometimes i wish i could just get a hug from somebody, literally anybody. I just want to be held, but i can&amp;#39;t even find anyone to do that. No one gives a fuck either. People always abandon me when they tell me they&amp;#39;ll always be here for me, but they&amp;#39;re never anywhere to be found. The thought of killing myself used to scare me and i would always wonder where i would go, but now the thought of it makes me feel calm and i really don&amp;#39;t care what&amp;#39;s on the other side anymore or even if there is another side. I never knew what it was like to truly be happy and feel loved. I feel so trapped. I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do. I emailed them and inquired about prices. They responded and i told myself i would delete it, but i still have it. That&amp;#39;s honestly what scares me. I&amp;#39;m not afraid to die anymore. I can&amp;#39;t even sleep and suffer from horrible insomnia and addiction. I can&amp;#39;t remember the last time i genuinely felt tired without sleeping pills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i got 5150&amp;#39;d a few weeks ago bc i told my therapist that i had vivid plans of ending my life. at the time, i only said that bc i was so stressed due to balancing my CNA job and pre-nursing classes. the doctor prescribed me lexapro. i stopped taking it after 2 weeks bc my mom found the pills on my bedside table and was upset, started telling me that all of this anxiety/stress was just in my head. she told me &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re normal, you dont need pills&amp;quot; and i just stopped taking them bc i felt like she was right and i was just overreacting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im just rambling now. i constantly feel like im on panic mode every time im at work bc its a high-stress healthcare job, and the rare moments where i make patients&amp;#39; days better or make them smile are everything to me, but im so tired of everything else. i only pursued nursing because my mother told me to. if i cant handle being a CNA, what makes me think i can handle being a nurse? i dont have the courage to tell her i dont want this, that im burnt out and im losing myself while pursuing this path that she decided for me when i was 12, a path that im not even sure about. i have no more motivation or energy to try to change my situation anymore. i feel like i dont deserve to be happy, and therefore theres no point in trying to change my life in an effort to be happy. ill keep pretending that im okay in front of my mother bc i love her. ill keep going to class, keep studying, keep working, and wait out the days until i eventually find it in me to take a knife and stab myself. &lt;/p&gt;

Some of the things that have happened to y’all was out of your control but this right here is completely in my control- but I just can’t seem to change. I’m not considering killin myself but I sure am considered self harming drinking/ and cutting so I can forget about this feeling and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel burned out everywhere. I haven’t really left the house for anything besides work for a couple months now. I work night shift so I sleep during the day but even on my off days I don’t have the motivation to leave my bed. Nothing gets me excited anymore even the things I’ve loved. And to add even more disappointment, I’ve been dropped from my psychiatrist. I followed treatment for a year not, but I missed an appointment last week and then I received a letter that stated I was being dropped due to non-compliance. I have never missed an appt since I started so it threw me for a loop. I don’t know what to do. I can talk to my family about any of this but I can’t hold it in anymore. I feel like I’m going to burst. My thought keeps going toward suicide at every point. I don’t feel like I have roots anywhere anymore so it’s not like it would matter.

Heads I win, tails I lose. If I win I stay, if I lose well, see ya space cowboy. There is no fixing my issues. I know that&amp;#39;s pretty much the standard statement for anyone in this position, but let me explain why it&amp;#39;s true for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a religious person, but I have some sense of spirituality and belief of something beyond this plane of exsistence. I believe that bad energy can permeate and infect anything, or vice versa with good energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an albatross around my neck that is not my own. See I was adopted as a baby. My mother was 15, my father 19. The thing is if bad energy infects things then my whole conception was spawned in evil. My mother wasn&amp;#39;t just underage, she was raped. And it was her first. That&amp;#39;s the kind of evil that created me. I think I am a demon. The albatross I wear is not mine, but it is around my neck because it&amp;#39;s what spawned me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reflecting a lot on my life recently, and if bad energy infects everything then I have infected almost everything I touch. I hurt everyone, I manipulate people, I push people to their limits. I have a sick sadistic need to take out my emotional pain sexually, like if I could just give somebody this physical pain it will take away from my emotional pain. But it doesn&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s the demon. I am the demon and it spreads hate, misery and sorrow because that is what it was born in. There is no lasting happiness, all of my successes come at the expense of others failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a curse. As I reflect on my life I want to think I&amp;#39;ve done good for people that I cared about but the truth is my moral compass is fucked, I&amp;#39;m a narcissist probably, or worse, a full fledged psychopath idk. Either way the demon needs to go but he won&amp;#39;t leave me on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m the black sheep who removed themselves from hurtful situations but now I torture myself with me thoughts.

She said I broke her heart and she doesn’t trust me and wouldn’t even know how to build a relationship. All of this because I called out some hurtful actions on her behalf and wouldn’t just let it go like usual. I’d been learning to stand up for myself. Now I’m just so sad all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my husband as he knew I was sad that I’m just on the edge, that I want to set him up then just not be here anymore. He said I think too much and need to concentrate on just sorting one issue out at a time. Hes just happy I talked to him but when I mentioned getting help from the GP he said the drugs make me doppy. I don’t know what to do. I want out, I want the hurt of rejection and self loathing to end. I went to sleep last night and just willed my body not to wake up. Passing in your sleep would be so easy. I’ve a bunch of diazepam too, less mess. I also want to take myself off to A&amp;amp;E but I’m worried about making things much harder for my husband. He’s in a shite situation at the moment too.

&lt;p&gt;Sigo viviendo con mis padres, no tengo plata para independizarme, si me junto con amigos, me deprime escucharlos hablar de sus vidas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algunos de los amigos de mi juventud, que decían ser mis amigos, después hacían cosas y me dejaban de lado, entre muchas otras cosas, como una familia disfuncional hicieron que mi depresión crezca, hubo muchos momentos de vacío en donde me quedaba en casa porque no tenía nada para hacer, estaba deprimido y había una estúpida esperanza en mi que decía que todo iba a mejorar solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo único que hoy por hoy me mantiene a flote es el jiujitsu, tato de ir seguido porque es de los pocos momentos de mi vida que hoy por hoy me hacen sentir bien, todo o demás es un desastre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siento que perdí mi vida, ojalá la pudiera recuperar, lamentablemente no puedo, últimamente he pensado en suicidarme, no lo he intentado, tampoco pensé en como podría hacerlo, pero es un pensamiento que pasa por mi cabeza, o único que me da u poco de esperanza es que vi que por mi edad puedo hacer un work and holiday a Australia, y la plata la tengo iría solo porque nadie quiere ir conmigo, es una incertidumbre grande, pero es eso o el suicidio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por el momento todo lo que siento es dolor, depresión, me siento inmóvil, se que sería lo correcto hacer ese viaje, pero por otro lado solo quiero ir a mi cama a llorar y lamentarme.&lt;/p&gt;

My days are spent doing nothing and getting none of what i’m supposed to do done and i can’t bring myself to do something as simple as read a book. i have no friends that i can talk to besides online friends, but even then, i bother them too much. I have about 3 months left and then i’m gone, but i don’t know if i will even wait that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before posting that comment, I actually deleted something under the obligatory PSA statement. It was a rather insightful metaphor about my mental health. I&amp;#39;m wondering if I should be concerned about it. I figure that question is self answering since I came to post it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My will to live might not necessarily be &lt;em&gt;firmly grasped&lt;/em&gt; in my hand, but it is still &lt;strong&gt;in my hand&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I&amp;#39;m afraid of what posting here might mean for me. Once I press the post button, it becomes real doesn&amp;#39;t it? This thing I have to deal with. This thing I can&amp;#39;t just shove into the corner and pretend doesn&amp;#39;t exist. I almost hope that no one responds to this, because then I&amp;#39;ll be able to pretend I never posted it. But that won&amp;#39;t happen will it? Because pressing that post button will utterly break the whole thing, won&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if, when I finally press the post button, the memory of pressing the post button will have the texture of shattered glass like that other memory..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid. I don&amp;#39;t want another memory with the texture of shattered glass. It&amp;#39;s not like I think it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; to happen, but it &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; happened once before, so that means it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; happen again, right?&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m Bruno, I&amp;#39;m from Argentina. i&amp;#39;m 22 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life is very miserable.
For as long as I can remember, I&amp;#39;ve suffered severe family abuse.
It started as verbal abuse, until it escalated into physical violence, to the point where my father threw me from a second-floor apartment.
When I was 11, my mother tried to drown me in a pool out of anger.
I&amp;#39;ve spent my miserable 22 years in relationships with people who didn&amp;#39;t value me. Today, I broke up for the second time with one of my last relationships. This completely broke me.
Now I find myself alone, without friends... without anyone who loves me. I&amp;#39;m financially bankrupt; I barely make ends meet for this month&amp;#39;s rent... I haven&amp;#39;t eaten in over a week.
I had a marijuana addiction, but since I ran out of everything I had, I no longer have a way to escape my reality.
I wish I had a friend who would be there for me. Because of the trauma, I developed PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) and BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).
I live alone, and I haven&amp;#39;t received a hug in years, let alone a sincere &amp;quot;I love you.&amp;quot;
I don&amp;#39;t see a way out of so much trauma and pain. I&amp;#39;m here because you&amp;#39;re my last option. Do any of you really see any meaning in my life? Does it make sense to continue with all this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at the flor 21, specifically in the roof. This maybe &amp;#39;ll be my last post.&lt;/p&gt;

I was liked and appreciated more when I was a dumb kid who genuinely bullied and antagonised people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself and want to die. I don’t want to upset my parents and my family so I can’t. I just want to give up though. I’m halfway through my 20s and I have nothing to show for it. I’ll be 30 within the blink of a&lt;/p&gt;

I recently began to remember rape by my father from when I was a child and it is making me very depressed and I want to end it because I can&amp;#39;t believe I randomly had a flashback about this over a decade later. I trusted my dad thinking he protected me and it feels like a HUGE stab in the back. I&amp;#39;ve known this for about a month now and I can&amp;#39;t believe he would do this to me. I confronted him recently and since then, he has repeatedly blocked me when trying to confront him again because I was so angry and I still am angry. Part of me still loves him because he is my father and I just wish he loved me back enough to actually be a caring father and not do things like that. I thought I could trust him all these years. The other part of me wants to get revenge, but he is my father and I wish he actually cared. I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;m going to end it, but suicide is once again on my mind. I get somatic flashbacks everyday and I can&amp;#39;t deal with the constant reminders anymore. I&amp;#39;m done. If my own father is willing to do that to me and hates me for confronting him, I have no reason to live. I just want a father who cares. Someone who cares would never rape me. I just want to be his little princess, but I can&amp;#39;t. I would be scared to be around him now. I moved out of his house last year and part of me misses him, but I can&amp;#39;t be around him anymore after remembering what he did. I&amp;#39;m very depressed and it makes me want to kill myself. Once again my dad is making me lose my will to live. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am suffering so much. This is unbearable. I’ve been sobbing all day. Im so distraught. I broke up with my girlfriend today. I love her so so much, but there were things she would say or do and it would break my heart. I just couldn’t be hurt anymore. I also do not have a job and have been unemployed since the end of August 2024, despite many interviews and hundreds of applications sent out. It felt like i mentally checked out of the entire day, like an immense blur of disassociating and crying (currently am right now, I can’t stop). My emotions are overpowering me, totally and completely and i just feel fucking horrible. I’m so scared to keep going, but im kinda scared of dying and having the lights go out forever. It’s just so immensely difficult to keep a hopeful attitude. I don’t want to suffer anymore. It physically hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;#39;t thought about suicide this much since I attempted when i was 16, but at least there was some form of hope back then. Now I realise that I either have to get used to working myself to death forever or just kill myself now. 
Surely everyone is suicidal and just pretends they&amp;#39;re not and are too scared to do it?? How can this existence make anyone feel any other way i just don&amp;#39;t fucking get it&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m just constantly terrified and I know I don&amp;#39;t have a future. I&amp;#39;m just a stupid autistic girl who can barely do anything. My parents never taught me anything growing up and I&amp;#39;m borderline being neglected by them I think. I couldn&amp;#39;t get through my first year of high school because everyone was so violently judgemental and ableist and I started skipping school and the teachers barely supported me. Near the end I began being sent home within a few hours because I would have panic attacks. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. Ever since the quarantine I just haven&amp;#39;t ever been able to do anything. I can&amp;#39;t do my schoolwork even if I try my hardest. I&amp;#39;m pathetic, a lot of people in this world hate me because of things I did when I was younger and didn&amp;#39;t know any better. No one forgives me. I just want someone to forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents divorced when I was three and I primarily live with my mom but she&amp;#39;s always too busy at work, smoking weed or watching TV to talk to me or teach me things. Whenever I try to ask it&amp;#39;s always &amp;quot;tomorrow&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;some other time&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m scared, I don&amp;#39;t want to live in this world knowing I&amp;#39;ll never be understood or ever know how to do the most basic of things. My bed&amp;#39;s mattress is stained in old period blood and I sleep with carpet beetles, my room is small and it&amp;#39;s a mess, I&amp;#39;m scared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have medication, Zoloft specifically, but I barely care enough anymore. The pills won&amp;#39;t prevent me from being any less pathetic than I am now. I know I&amp;#39;m just going to grow up to be a womanchild who still lives with her parents at 30 or something. I don&amp;#39;t even know what to do anymore, I barely know who I am because I spend all of my time roleplaying with my friends online. I&amp;#39;ve wanted to die ever since second grade even though I barely understood. I grew up with anger issues and no one understood me. I started getting upset and scratching myself, hitting myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could go to the hospital, I wish I could get help, I want to go to a facility and heal, but I don&amp;#39;t know how to survive on my own. Over a year ago now I was admitted to the hospital and they were planning on sending me to a facility but the main concerns were the fact that I typically only eat a few things because I never grew up trying new foods and the fact that I don&amp;#39;t know how to do a lot of things on my own. I&amp;#39;m 15 and I don&amp;#39;t know how to ride a bike or tie shoes or anything, I only recently started microwaving breakfast for myself and even that can stress me out. I don&amp;#39;t know how to do my own hair, I still have my mom do it for me, I&amp;#39;m so utterly pathetic that I disgust myself, I don&amp;#39;t want to get my parents in trouble because I know they love me and care about me. I can&amp;#39;t change the past and I can only continue living this pathetic life or I can die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that my family and my cats would be upset if I died but at this point I&amp;#39;m starting not to care. My cats don&amp;#39;t even depend on me to take care of them because I don&amp;#39;t know how to. I grew up with barely any discipline and no chores so I don&amp;#39;t even know how to help my parents. I know my parents love me even though they&amp;#39;re neglecting me. I&amp;#39;m genuinely terrified and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I&amp;#39;ve attempted suicide many times but I always get too scared to do anything extreme. I don&amp;#39;t want to survive and suffer because I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of research about it. If I slit my wrist I could survive but be in extreme pain, if I jump off of a building I could just break my legs, if I overdose I could throw up, if I cut my throat I could survive but not be able to talk, etc. Every night I fall asleep thinking about what to write in my suicide note while crying. I&amp;#39;m not in normal school anymore and I do online school which is more lenient but I can still barely get anything done, I don&amp;#39;t know what the hell is wrong with me I&amp;#39;m scared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car was a big part of my life but anxiety and depression caused me to just toss it aside like a piece of garbage. Now I wish I had it back and am having tons of anxiety and depression over it being gone. &lt;/p&gt;

I feel like a calamity, everything I touch goes bad. My entire life is a shitshow. I was raped multiple times by my own cousin when I was younger. Couldn&amp;#39;t tell my parents due to fear of being abandoned and not being believed. Now that my parents know, they still appease the rapist&amp;#39;s parents wothout any care for me. They tell me to forget what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and cptsd. Therapy is kicking my ass as I&amp;#39;m focusing on trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was emotionally neglected by my family. My friends in school told me that nobody wants me around and I should go away. I was alone and without any friends after they left me for 3 years. Trusting anyone is still so difficult for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m being forced into arranged marriage by my parents because according to them, they will die sooner or later and I will be left alone my entire life. I tried speaking to someone but got rejected because I&amp;#39;m mentally sick and have to take medication for it. I like someone whom I can&amp;#39;t be with due to distance. We are good friends still but I keep wishing for more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not one thing that is okay in my life that I could use as an anchor to bide my time. I&amp;#39;m just so exhausted of the mental battle everyday, no support from anyone, no care or love from anyone, the helplessness and the hopelessness. I&amp;#39;m so so tired. Every night I find myself wanting to sleep forever and hate it when I wake up the next morning&lt;/p&gt;

I currently sleep on the couch at my parent’s house, which consists of my grandparents living in an adjacent house (apartment? Two homes together). My dad remarried and though my step family is nice, I find myself isolating from them whenever I feel very anxious or paranoid. I honestly don’t feel comfortable around any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And people tend to come over to the house often. I don’t feel safe and I can’t relax. I’m hyperventilated all the time. My family loves to have friends and family over. Today is my uncle’s birthday and I’m currently hiding in my father’s room under his bed. It’s not about how I feel. It’s his birthday so I need to stop being so self centered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out of the room to great everyone and then I retreated back to my dad’s room because my bed is often used as a place for everyone to sit. And the kids love to eat on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have severe social anxiety, ocd and depression. I know to survive in this world you need to be around people. And honestly I let so many opportunities slip me by. I keep thinking about going to college but I keep pushing it off to different semesters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use an excuse that I’m worried about debt. I really am and I’m a new Florida resident so I won’t be able to get Florida residency right away. By the way if I didn’t leave to go back to my mom’s when I was 24, I could have gotten tuition under my father. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m seriously a dumb and pathetic immature bitch! I know I need to be patient but every day I think about leaving and just living on the streets. Or you know not waking up ever again but I’m a big coward. I’m tired of moving back and forth between my family with no direction in my life. I’m stupid and I literally don’t know how to put my life together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently don’t have a job. I haven’t had one for 2 years. I barely worked since I first turned 20. I think I had only 3 jobs during these 5 years. I have chronic pain (fibromyalgia but I’m honestly not sure if it’s that) but it seems to flare up with stress. And I was a dumbass. When I went back to South Carolina to live with my mother and then later my grandmother. I got to see a doctor but I was worried about medical bills. And I gave up too quickly when I tried medicine due to some bad sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every chance I’ve had to change my life. I ruined it. By the way, I know I’m being ungrateful. I have a roof over my head, food to eat and my parents take care of my basic needs. So the lack of privacy should be the least of my worries. I help watch my brothers on school days. I feed my brother lunch though my grandma tends to help me feed him breakfast sometimes because he’s a picky eater. But I’m really bad at babysitting. And getting my brother from the bus stop every day gives me anxiety because I have to be around people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently on antidepressants. I see a psychiatrist. I’m getting a new therapist. And I still talk to my old one from South Carolina. I went the hospital a couple times after calling the ambulance for suicidal ideation. And on thanksgiving I went to the hospital for taking fucking 10 Benadryls. Because I talk to a hotline about how I was feeling. I’m only about to get antidepressants through my mother’s insurance who’s still in South Carolina. I feel like a failure. A woman child. I keep thinking that I won’t be able to survive in this world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a lot of word salad but I feel so hopeless. I don’t know what to do. I was planning to go to goodwill’s job center on Friday to work on my resume. But I ended up crying in my dad’s room after greeting everyone and hearing them whisper about how pathetic I am for my age. This whole time I was feeling paranoid and everyone talking behind my back. My dad and my step family said it was all in my head. I was right the whole time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about running away even though I’m fucking 25. 
It will be the same no matter which family member I live with. And if I go back to my mother’s I’ll probably never try to get out there again. I’d hide away from the world in my tall tower. But I fear if not running away one day I’ll go to sleep forever. Again this is a lot and I’m sorry for all the word salad. This is kind of like a vent. If this isn’t the right group post in. Please let me know where it would be appropriate to share my inner thoughts and worries.&lt;/p&gt;

I was 16, hated life, and felt like a burden to everyone. I genuinely felt worthless. I had no reason in particular for feeling so depressed, I just hated everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After feeling that way for months, last april I attempted. It didnt work, obviously. Afterwards I got all the help I needed. I went to therapy and took a break from my life. I became someone completely different and for once I was actually happy. It took time and I didnt just suddenly wake up full of joy, but sometimes you just have to wait things out in life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that really helped me get out of such a dark place was picking up new hobbies. I started baking. I wasnt good at the start by any means but I absolutely loved it. On happy days I would bake and on bad days I would bake. It really helped me distract myself and give my life something worth living for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that helped is to just spend time with people. I know thats not easy for a lot of people, but for people who are close with their friends and siblings. Let them know how youre feeling and what they can do to help you. Asking for help when youre feeling low isnt being a burden. Even if its just asking to go for a walk or to go for coffee, it can really change your mood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do not remember days, we remember moments” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is focus on having good moments. Forget about the days. Just have good moments and the rest will all work out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this will probably go over most peoples heads because I doubt anyone will be “inspired” by some 17 year old ranting about loving life on an anonymous app but I hope this reaches the people who need to see it. I’ve been there and I know how it feels. You just have to keep going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i also had to talk to my brother’s case worker today and talk about my childhood sexual abuse i endured at the hands of his father/my ex-stepfather and abuser. i had therapy today but im just so triggered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everything is happening at once and i wish i could deal with one thing at a time. i’m overwhelmed. it’s too much, it’s too much pain and grief. i can’t handle it. all of my trauma is rearing its ugly head right now. and i just want my brain to shut up. i just want to disappear. i can’t take it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was broken up with last year and my ex was abusive emotionally and mentally and was sexually coercive. i feel broken. so much sexual trauma. so much emotional baggage. nobody will ever love me. i’ll be single forever. i’ll die alone&lt;/p&gt;

Last night I found out my Life Insurance policy will pay out in full regardless of how I die in a little over 2 months. The sense of relief is amazing. It is so strange how the most alive I have felt in years in planning to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last couple of weeks paying off all of my wife&amp;#39;s bills and moving money to a place where it is safe for her. I have been writing her letters, and letters to my kids. That is by far the hardest part. It makes me cry now just thinking of leaving them. My Journaling has been the only thing I look forward to in the day. I am trying so hard to explain, but really I am just explaining it to myself. Because I have never been able to understand why I cannot just be happy. I hope my wife and kids find all of these things some day,so everyone knows it is not their fault and it is just what I wanted. I&amp;#39;m not even depressed anymore. Having a date in mind is the first time I have felt happy in years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is getting close now. I am thinking about taking all of my flyer miles and credit card points and disappearing, or taking my family somewhere. It is hard because I have been trying to distance myself so they get used to me not being there. But all I want is to be around them right now. I am a lost soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told some people close to me I’m going to finally do it or get some help, with the caveat I’d get help first. I got referred from one hospital to a hospital that was closed. I was so mad. They said if I went to emergency maybe I could see someone. I’m too proud for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 26. I have known I wanted to do this since Halloween, my birthday, and almost told my girlfriend at the time that I was going to do it. I said to her instead that if I had another year like this, I could at least join the 27 club. I tried to make light of it, but she generally misunderstood the issues anyways. I broke up with her around the holidays because I could not imagine us having a future together, I could not even imagine a day in advance. I still can’t. There is a construction site really close to my house that I’m certain I can sneak onto and hop off of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to work on Tuesday. I think if they found out I tried to commit suicide, they may fire me. I don’t think I could call in either for a mental health crisis or anything. Needless to say, I’d rather just do it once than ruin my life further. I am supposed to return to school in September, but it’s too far away. I tried to do so much to give myself something to be romantic about and hope for, but nothing is enough. All I need is money. Everything I’d want to be and achieve costs money. I look to inherit nothing - my father is a crackhead, my mother is schizophrenic. The families they come from are filled with people who want only distance or are themselves problematic. I don’t know who I can turn to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried calling these warm lines and I just sat there and listened to this elevator music while the occasional ‘call 911 if this is emergency’ message kept coming up. I just am so mad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what else to say. I definitely don’t have the wherewithal for this anymore. I think it was a conversation I had with a friend about how I thought having to accept things are getting worse, lesser than two-evilsisms was just awful and that there had to be other ways, other options. I could not convince them. I don’t know if I’d even make the argument anymore. I don’t know what I’m even talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m drinking pretty heavily and the weather isn’t bad enough to keep me inside. What do I do if I’m arrested? I’m in Canada, is assisted suicide an option for depression? I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t know what I’m even asking for here.&lt;/p&gt;

I accidentally knocked it over and I was going to pick it up after I washed my hands. After I washed my hands I got lost in thought and I guess I moved my foot just slightly because I heard a shattering sound. It split right in half. I have no idea what to do. There&amp;#39;s someone living right by the airbnb and I&amp;#39;m so scared they heard it and will tell the owner. I have no idea how I&amp;#39;m going to tell the owner or my parents since they paid for the airbnb. Chances are they&amp;#39;ll have to pay for it and they&amp;#39;ll be ashamed of me. I just got here and I have people coming over while I&amp;#39;m here and I have no idea how to hide it. I just want to kill myself even more now. I was right, I mess everything up. I&amp;#39;m worthless. I should be dead. Maybe I can use one of the kitchen knives to end it?  Anyone have any tips on stabbing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of life, nothing is going well for me right now. I can’t support myself so I’m living with my abusive narcissistic mom and she’s been very abusive towards me everyday and night. I can’t really get into it because it’s a lot of different things and most of the time people don’t believe me. She taunts me about my poor mental health and my appearance and has told me I’m worthless and that I should go kill myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried really hard I have to try to get on my own feet. I’ve been unemployed for 4 months now and have applied to over 10 jobs already which sounds very little but it’s a lot to get interviews and all rejections from all of them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just so disappointed I put myself in debt to have a b.s. in business admin and I can’t even get a simple job at being a teller in the new area I’m in despite having 2 years of teller experience under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have one friend but he’s moving to socal after the summer to go to school&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So right now I’m broke, lonely, suffering with health isssues from stress including prediavetes. Being a literal human punching back for this piece of shit that gave birth to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to do it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a noose tied up and ready under the car seat on the passenger side, I’m prepped I’m planning to do it this weekend while the monster is on her trip this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m look up bridges to hangmyswlf from but I’m scared that when I’m about to do it I’ll chicken out like the last couple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish god would just take me, I wish I could just get medical assisted suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I have a enough of any illicit drug that I could OD &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something quick and painless&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m scared that as I’m tying the rope around the bridge railing and see the dark choppy water below I’ll hurl and freak out and give up and return back to my shitty life for more abuse, failure, and humiliation &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is unfair why do people like her get to get away with everything and mistreating me like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I have to work so hard to apply to all these jobs and none of them could’ve given me the time of day or just a chance I really know that I’m capable of being a really good worker but no one around me sees that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate being so broke that i can’t do anything but stay at home and deal with her and can’t do anything I desire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could encounter someone to hypnotize me into killing myself so I don’t think about it and I’m successful &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please please just take me out &lt;/p&gt;

But i have a great life my parents are divorced and mom is remarried and dad is bipolar but he loves me like crazy and mom is really kind a loving , they have a bit of toxicity like any other parents but they care , not enough clearly but i know they are trying their best 
I have siblings that are 14 and 16 years older and they care for me and provide shit and my sis also cares and i can talk to her but not about this 
When i was really young like 7-8  (im 16) we were poor but now we can technically afford anything we need and a lot of what we want 
. I have friends and relatives that love me 
And shit im not an ugly or fat person im a girl who is 6ft and 60kg with long curly brown hair and everyone says im pretty . I have acne but then again who doesn’t . 
I can only think of one thing that could cause this and im ashamed but also i dont understand my brain anymore . I have a friend 16 F and she is a bit crazy and a shitty friend who always fucks with me and my self esteem and does rude and mean things for no reason 
But just when i started to distance myself she dropped the bomb that she attempted suicide 5 times and since she has a pattern of lying i didnt believe her , i told only the principal and assured him to not tell anyone and stopped talking to her and i didnt tell anyone else and she retaliated by making everyone in class hate her with her actions they started to lightly bully her and i just ignored it all . She then started to look like a zombie and dropped everything school related , she went from getting A’s to C’s and she let her appearance go . 
A few weeks ago i was in the bathroom having my 7th nose bleed of the day and she asked to borrow my phone, she went into a stall and called her mom and she sobbed to her to just pick her up , when she came out she was bawling and saying she was just tired of life and i felt a gut punch . I realized that she might not be lying for the first time . 
I went to class and packed her shit while everyone starred cuz they knew we weren’t talking but not the reason . I sat in class and shit i felt a panick attack coming on but i was in french and the teacher is really nosy but quite nice so i just masked it , i didn’t want to pass out infront of everyone . 
Went home and started feeling like i should just jump . I made a list of the ways i could end it and crossed the worst options but i didn’t want to plan it yet but by the second week of this shit i knew i wanted to die . Life has no meaning , i tried to get help and on tiktok i saw that watching 13 reasons why was a good way to cope , that show made things worse for me . 
I have always had anxiety but now i couldn’t go a day whitout it . 
I felt like all life lost meaning and felt so fucking guilty for not being there for my friend tho she was horrible but she deserved sm1 that cared . I guess its karma or just that i finally understood her . 
But now its much deeper than guilt it real intrusive and suicidal toughts and my anxiety gets so bad when i try to talk to her to right my wrong . I know that i seem pathetic and i have no reason to want to die but this is just how i feel 
Please offer advice i need to know what to do i dont want to cause my family harm and go to hell for ending things but idk anymore 
Existence is meaningless &lt;/p&gt;

My doctor wants me on this medication called spravato. I have been on a waiting list for 7 months now. How do they expect me to keep waiting? Everyday is a struggle. I sleep all day.

&lt;p&gt;I hit a new low recently and feared becoming homeless. My life has been tough, abusive parents, bad relationships, and constant financial struggles. I worked hard, avoided substance abuse, and did years of therapy, but stability always felt out of reach. Over 40 now, I’ve had roommates most of my adult life due to bad credit and poor financial choices and mostly low income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I thought I secured a stable job, only to be ghosted. I took a terrible job to survive, then struggled to get interviews because my tenure was too short. Political chaos made everything worse. I spiraled too much TV, mobile games, and self-hate while pretending I was fine. The final blow came when my boss fired me after I went to the ER for suicidal thoughts, I can&amp;#39;t prove this is why I was fired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly gave up, but something in me—maybe pettiness, maybe resilience—said to keep going. I used rubber bands instead of self-harm, rode out the dark days, and today, I got a job offer today that will help me get back on track, its stable and offers good money. I could’ve missed this chance. I&amp;#39;ve had 3 interviews in 6 months and I finally got the one that mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to say life is always worth it. I know how deep the pain goes, but I’ve realized I want to be better at handling setbacks. I want love, stability, and a future. Through the years of being broke I&amp;#39;ve figured out ways to make a better living for myself. Certificates to get, how to afford finishing college. Financial literacy is key. Emotional resilience is key and I don&amp;#39;t want to give up on the life I envisioned for myself. And if you’re struggling, I see you. My DMs are open. You matter. 💙&lt;/p&gt;
