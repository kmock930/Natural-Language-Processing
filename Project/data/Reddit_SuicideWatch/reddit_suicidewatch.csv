SuicideWatch,"I reached a really low point today. I am struggling a lot financially trying to support my two kids. I may lose my house. I work full time and I do my best but it's never enough. I made a whole plan today to get a huge life insurance policy. One that still pays out after unaliving, and I figure I just wait the year or so and then I will know they are well taken care of for the rest of their lives. 

It is better for them I think to have the structure of keeping their home and not having to worry about their next meal or clothes or anything. I promised myself they would never need for anything. 

IDK what else to do because I feel like that's exactly what a good mother would do. Anything for their children. It's my fault we are struggling. I left a very unhappy marriage almost a year ago. Selfishly. If I had stayed there they wouldn't need anything because my ex made good money. But when I left him, he left his job and now doesn't pay almost anything for child support since he doesn't work. 

I was selfish and a bad mother. And now it's my fault they may suffer. So it's my job to make it right for them.

SuicideWatch,"hi everyone. i’ve tried to be GOOD for as long as i can remember. i’ve always tried to pick a job where i was helping someone; i volunteered and worked at the animal shelter for years, became a 911 dispatcher, have tried to always help people and go out of my way whenever i can. 

i got into a decent spot mentally, but then i moved back in with my mom. she has reminded me within a couple weeks who i really am. we never had a good relationship when i was growing up. she was going through a lot and i was the one who was more outspoken, so she took a lot of frustration out on me. i moved out at 18 but moved back in at 21. 

she’s explained to me that i am verbally abusive; i bring stuff up from the past way too much, and hurt her feelings with things that she’s done in the past that she doesn’t remember doing (but i somehow remember every detail). she says that she’s known me for a long time, and i am not capable of doing certain things. the thing that hurts most is that she’s reminded me over and over that i’m the most selfish person she’s met because i don’t see other people’s perspectives.

and you know what? she’s right. i’m not a good student, i’m not good at my job, im not a easy person to get along with. i don’t have any hobbies that im especially good at. i don’t have any friends. i have my cat, but my mom says she takes better care of her than i do. i have nobody. if i disappeared, nobody would realize. as soon as i move out of here, i’ll literally have no family, no friends, nothing. there is nothing to keep me here.

no matter how good i try to be, i have never been. i’ll never be good.

SuicideWatch,"I'm going to flip a coin. Heads I win, tails I lose. If I win I stay, if I lose well, see ya space cowboy. There is no fixing my issues. I know that's pretty much the standard statement for anyone in this position, but let me explain why it's true for me.

I'm not a religious person, but I have some sense of spirituality and belief of something beyond this plane of exsistence. I believe that bad energy can permeate and infect anything, or vice versa with good energy.

I have an albatross around my neck that is not my own. See I was adopted as a baby. My mother was 15, my father 19. The thing is if bad energy infects things then my whole conception was spawned in evil. My mother wasn't just underage, she was raped. And it was her first. That's the kind of evil that created me. I think I am a demon. The albatross I wear is not mine, but it is around my neck because it's what spawned me.

I have been reflecting a lot on my life recently, and if bad energy infects everything then I have infected almost everything I touch. I hurt everyone, I manipulate people, I push people to their limits. I have a sick sadistic need to take out my emotional pain sexually, like if I could just give somebody this physical pain it will take away from my emotional pain. But it doesn't, it's the demon. I am the demon and it spreads hate, misery and sorrow because that is what it was born in. There is no lasting happiness, all of my successes come at the expense of others failures.

It's a curse. As I reflect on my life I want to think I've done good for people that I cared about but the truth is my moral compass is fucked, I'm a narcissist probably, or worse, a full fledged psychopath idk.

Before posting that comment, I actually deleted something under the obligatory PSA statement. It was a rather insightful metaphor about my mental health. I'm wondering if I should be concerned about it. I figure that question is self answering since I came to post it here.

My will to live might not necessarily be *firmly grasped* in my hand, but it is still **in my hand**.

My life is very miserable.
For as long as I can remember, I've suffered severe family abuse.
It started as verbal abuse, until it escalated into physical violence, to the point where my father threw me from a second-floor apartment.
When I was 11, my mother tried to drown me in a pool out of anger.
I've spent my miserable 22 years in relationships with people who didn't value me. Today, I broke up for the second time with one of my last relationships. This completely broke me.
Now I find myself alone, without friends... without anyone who loves me. I'm financially bankrupt; I barely make ends meet for this month's rent... I haven't eaten in over a week.
I had a marijuana addiction, but since I ran out of everything I had, I no longer have a way to escape my reality.
I wish I had a friend who would be there for me. Because of the trauma, I developed PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) and BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).
I live alone, and I haven't received a hug in years, let alone a sincere ""I love you.""

I live alone, and I haven&amp;#39;t received a hug in years, let alone a sincere &amp;quot;I love you.&amp;quot;
I don&amp;#39;t see a way out of so much trauma and pain. I&amp;#39;m here because you&amp;#39;re my last option. Do any of you really see any meaning in my life? Does it make sense to continue with all this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at the flor 21, specifically in the roof. This maybe &amp;#39;ll be my last post.&lt;/p&gt;

Even my birthday I asked 20 people and one showed up who was my girlfriend (gone now). I guess my question is, how do I keep going with a high head while I have depression and all of these expectations and none of my friends include me? I’ve had suicidal thoughts for years but have anxiety attacks about death bc I’ve been scared of it since I was 6. Idk man I might just be fucked and I don’t want to look like a “my life’s so bad feel bad for me” person, but I’m just tired yk? If you read this all thank you for your time, and whatever you’re going though I’m proud of you &lt;/p&gt;

I'm just a stupid autistic girl who can barely do anything. My parents never taught me anything growing up and I'm borderline being neglected by them I think. I couldn't get through my first year of high school because everyone was so violently judgemental and ableist and I started skipping school and the teachers barely supported me. Near the end I began being sent home within a few hours because I would have panic attacks. I don't know what to do anymore. Ever since the quarantine I just haven't ever been able to do anything. I can't do my schoolwork even if I try my hardest. I'm pathetic, a lot of people in this world hate me because of things I did when I was younger and didn't know any better. No one forgives me. I just want someone to forgive me.

My parents divorced when I was three and I primarily live with my mom but she's always too busy at work, smoking weed or watching TV to talk to me or teach me things. Whenever I try to ask it's always ""tomorrow"" or ""some other time"". I'm scared, I don't want to live in this world knowing I'll never be understood or ever know how to do the most basic of things. My bed's mattress is stained in old period blood and I sleep with carpet beetles, my room is small and it's a mess, I'm scared

I have medication, Zoloft specifically, but I barely care enough anymore. The pills won't prevent me from being any less pathetic than I am now. I know I'm just going to grow up to be a womanchild who still lives with her parents at 30 or something. I don't even know what to do anymore, I barely know who I am because I spend all of my time roleplaying with my friends online. I've wanted to die ever since second grade even though I barely understood. I grew up with anger issues and no one understood me. I started getting upset and scratching myself, hitting myself.

I wish I could go to the hospital, I wish I could get help, I want to go to a facility and heal, but I don't know how to survive on my own. Over a year ago now I was admitted to the hospital and they were planning on sending me to a facility but the main concerns were the fact that I typically only eat a few things because I never grew up trying new foods and the fact that I don't know how to do a lot of things on my own. I'm 15 and I don't know how to ride a bike or tie shoes or anything, I only recently started microwaving breakfast for myself and even that can stress me out. I don't know how to do my own hair, I still have my mom do it for me, I'm so utterly pathetic that I disgust myself, I don't want to get my parents in trouble because I know they love me and care about me. I can't change the past and I can only continue living this pathetic life or I can die.

I know that my family and my cats would be upset if I died but at this point I'm starting not to care. My cats don't even depend on me to take care of them because I don't know how to.

I'm genuinely terrified and I don't know what to do. I've attempted suicide many times but I always get too scared to do anything extreme.

SuicideWatch,"I’m a 25 year old woman. I currently sleep on the couch at my parent’s house, which consists of my grandparents living in an adjacent house (apartment? Two homes together). My dad remarried and though my step family is nice, I find myself isolating from them whenever I feel very anxious or paranoid. I honestly don’t feel comfortable around any of them.

And people tend to come over to the house often. I don’t feel safe and I can’t relax. I’m hyperventilated all the time. My family loves to have friends and family over. Today is my uncle’s birthday and I’m currently hiding in my father’s room under his bed. It’s not about how I feel. It’s his birthday so I need to stop being so self centered. 

I came out of the room to great everyone and then I retreated back to my dad’s room because my bed is often used as a place for everyone to sit. And the kids love to eat on it. 

I have severe social anxiety, ocd and depression. I know to survive in this world you need to be around people. And honestly I let so many opportunities slip me by. I keep thinking about going to college but I keep pushing it off to different semesters. 

I use an excuse that I’m worried about debt. I really am and I’m a new Florida resident so I won’t be able to get Florida residency right away. By the way if I didn’t leave to go back to my mom’s when I was 24, I could have gotten tuition under my father. 

I’m seriously a dumb and pathetic immature bitch! I know I need to be patient but every day I think about leaving and just living on the streets. Or you know not waking up ever again but I’m a big coward. I’m tired of moving back and forth between my family with no direction in my life. I’m stupid and I literally don’t know how to put my life together. 

I currently don’t have a job. I haven’t had one for 2 years. I barely worked since I first turned 20. I think I had only 3 jobs during these 5 years. I have chronic pain (fibromyalgia but I’m honestly not sure if it’s that) but it seems to flare up with stress. And I was a dumbass. When I went back to South Carolina to live with my mother and then later my grandmother. I got to see a doctor but I was worried about medical bills. And I gave up too quickly when I tried medicine due to some bad sides.

Every chance I’ve had to change my life. I ruined it. By the way, I know I’m being ungrateful. I have a roof over my head, food to eat and my parents take care of my basic needs. So the lack of privacy should be the least of my worries. I help watch my brothers on school days. I feed my brother lunch though my grandma tends to help me feed him breakfast sometimes because he’s a picky eater. But I’m really bad at babysitting. And getting my brother from the bus stop every day gives me anxiety because I have to be around people. 


I’m currently on antidepressants. I see a psychiatrist. I’m getting a new therapist. And I still talk to my old one from South Carolina. I went the hospital a couple times after calling the ambulance for suicidal ideation. And on thanksgiving I went to the hospital for taking fucking 10 Benadryls. Because I talk to a hotline about how I was feeling. I’m only about to get antidepressants through my mother’s insurance who’s still in South Carolina. I feel like a failure. A woman child. I keep thinking that I won’t be able to survive in this world. 


I know this is a lot of word salad but I feel so hopeless. I don’t know what to do. I was planning to go to goodwill’s job center on Friday to work on my resume. But I ended up crying in my dad’s room after greeting everyone and hearing them whisper about how pathetic I am for my age. This whole time I was feeling paranoid and everyone talking behind my back. My dad and my step family said it was all in my head. I was right the whole time. 

I keep thinking about running away even though I’m fucking 25. 
It will be the same no matter which family member I live with. And if I go back to my mother’s I’ll probably never try to get out there again. I’d hide away from the world in my tall tower.

After feeling that way for months, last april I attempted. It didnt work, obviously. Afterwards I got all the help I needed. I went to therapy and took a break from my life. I became someone completely different and for once I was actually happy. It took time and I didnt just suddenly wake up full of joy, but sometimes you just have to wait things out in life.

On happy days I would bake and on bad days I would bake. It really helped me distract myself and give my life something worth living for. 

Another thing that helped is to just spend time with people. I know thats not easy for a lot of people, but for people who are close with their friends and siblings.

next month, on the 5 is the anniversary of my cousin being found m*rdered after being the victim of a violent hate crime. april 6 is the anniversary of me getting r*ped. April 11 is the anniversary of my mom dying by suicide. 

i also had to talk to my brother’s case worker today and talk about my childhood sexual abuse i endured at the hands of his father/my ex-stepfather and abuser. i had therapy today but im just so triggered.

I really don’t have anything to complain about. I have a shopping addiction so missing some money but that’s all my fault. My family is fine even though it’s really hard sometimes and they clearly wish they didn’t have to deal with me. I don’t have any irl friends and live alone, with no one to talk to or do anything with. My online friends all come from Twitter and I always feel like they’re just staying friends with me to take advantage of me or because they’re faking it so I don’t crash out. I only have 2 real friends and they’re online, we can’t even meet. I’m fucking fat and can’t seem to get up my lady ass and get to work and lose weight by working out or eating better and being fat ruins my life more than anything else. I hate school but i need it to get a job I somehow like, but I know I’ll never actually like any job. I hate school right now and I’ll hate work after that. I’ll never be happy and I’ll always be miserable. I’m tired of living and everyday being the exact same and not being great and spending my days off recovering from school days.

I really don’t have anything to complain about. I have a shopping addiction so missing some money but that’s all my fault. My family is fine even though it’s really hard sometimes and they clearly wish they didn’t have to deal with me. I don’t have any irl friends and live alone, with no one to talk to or do anything with. My online friends all come from Twitter and I always feel like they’re just staying friends with me to take advantage of me or because they’re faking it so I don’t crash out. I only have 2 real friends and they’re online, we can’t even meet. I’m fucking fat and can’t seem to get up my lady ass and get to work and lose weight by working out or eating better and being fat ruins my life more than anything else. I hate school but i need it to get a job I somehow like, but I know I’ll never actually like any job. I hate school right now and I’ll hate work after that. I’ll never be happy and I’ll always be miserable. I’m tired of living and everyday being the exact same and not being great and spending my days off recovering from school days.

SuicideWatch,"I’m not on here posting this for anyone to convince me not to do it and keep living.

I’m tired of life, nothing is going well for me right now. I can’t support myself so I’m living with my abusive narcissistic mom and she’s been very abusive towards me everyday and night. I can’t really get into it because it’s a lot of different things and most of the time people don’t believe me. She taunts me about my poor mental health and my appearance and has told me I’m worthless and that I should go kill myself.

I’ve tried really hard I have to try to get on my own feet. I’ve been unemployed for 4 months now and have applied to over 10 jobs already which sounds very little but it’s a lot to get interviews and all rejections from all of them

I’m just so disappointed I put myself in debt to have a b.s. in business admin and I can’t even get a simple job at being a teller in the new area I’m in despite having 2 years of teller experience under my belt.

I only have one friend but he’s moving to socal after the summer to go to school

So right now I’m broke, lonely, suffering with health isssues from stress including prediavetes. Being a literal human punching back for this piece of shit that gave birth to me.

I don’t want to do it anymore.

I have a noose tied up and ready under the car seat on the passenger side, I’m prepped I’m planning to do it this weekend while the monster is on her trip this weekend.

I’m look up bridges to hangmyswlf from but I’m scared that when I’m about to do it I’ll chicken out like the last couple times.

I wish god would just take me, I wish I could just get medical assisted suicide.

Or maybe I have a enough of any illicit drug that I could OD 

Something quick and painless

I’m scared that as I’m tying the rope around the bridge railing and see the dark choppy water below I’ll hurl and freak out and give up and return back to my shitty life for more abuse, failure, and humiliation 

Life is unfair why do people like her get to get away with everything and mistreating me like this

Why did I have to work so hard to apply to all these jobs and none of them could’ve given me the time of day or just a chance I really know that I’m capable of being a really good worker but no one around me sees that

I hate being so broke that i can’t do anything but stay at home and deal with her and can’t do anything I desire

But i have a great life my parents are divorced and mom is remarried and dad is bipolar but he loves me like crazy and mom is really kind a loving , they have a bit of toxicity like any other parents but they care , not enough clearly but i know they are trying their best 
I have siblings that are 14 and 16 years older and they care for me and provide shit and my sis also cares and i can talk to her but not about this 
When i was really young like 7-8  (im 16) we were poor but now we can technically afford anything we need and a lot of what we want 
. I have friends and relatives that love me 
And shit im not an ugly or fat person im a girl who is 6ft and 60kg with long curly brown hair and everyone says im pretty . I have acne but then again who doesn’t . 
I can only think of one thing that could cause this and im ashamed but also i dont understand my brain anymore . I have a friend 16 F and she is a bit crazy and a shitty friend who always fucks with me and my self esteem and does rude and mean things for no reason 
But just when i started to distance myself she dropped the bomb that she attempted suicide 5 times and since she has a pattern of lying i didnt believe her , i told only the principal and assured him to not tell anyone and stopped talking to her and i didnt tell anyone else and she retaliated by making everyone in class hate her with her actions they started to lightly bully her and i just ignored it all . She then started to look like a zombie and dropped everything school related , she went from getting A’s to C’s and she let her appearance go . 
A few weeks ago i was in the bathroom having my 7th nose bleed of the day and she asked to borrow my phone, she went into a stall and called her mom and she sobbed to her to just pick her up , when she came out she was bawling and saying she was just tired of life and i felt a gut punch . I realized that she might not be lying for the first time . 
I went to class and packed her shit while everyone starred cuz they knew we weren’t talking but not the reason . I sat in class and shit i felt a panick attack coming on but i was in french and the teacher is really nosy but quite nice so i just masked it , i didn’t want to pass out infront of everyone . 
Went home and started feeling like i should just jump . I made a list of the ways i could end it and crossed the worst options but i didn’t want to plan it yet but by the second week of this shit i knew i wanted to die . Life has no meaning , i tried to get help and on tiktok i saw that watching 13 reasons why was a good way to cope , that show made things worse for me . 
I have always had anxiety but now i couldn’t go a day whitout it . 
I felt like all life lost meaning and felt so fucking guilty for not being there for my friend tho she was horrible but she deserved sm1 that cared . I guess its karma or just that i finally understood her . 
But now its much deeper than guilt it real intrusive and suicidal toughts and my anxiety gets so bad when i try to talk to her to right my wrong . I know that i seem pathetic and i have no reason to want to die but this is just how i feel

Over 40 now, I’ve had roommates most of my adult life due to bad credit and poor financial choices and mostly low income. 

Last summer, I thought I secured a stable job, only to be ghosted. I took a terrible job to survive, then struggled to get interviews because my tenure was too short. Political chaos made everything worse. I spiraled too much TV, mobile games, and self-hate while pretending I was fine. The final blow came when my boss fired me after I went to the ER for suicidal thoughts, I can't prove this is why I was fired. 

I nearly gave up, but something in me—maybe pettiness, maybe resilience—said to keep going. I used rubber bands instead of self-harm, rode out the dark days, and today, I got a job offer today that will help me get back on track, its stable and offers good money. I could’ve missed this chance. I've had 3 interviews in 6 months and I finally got the one that mattered.

I’m not here to say life is always worth it. I know how deep the pain goes, but I’ve realized I want to be better at handling setbacks. I want love, stability, and a future. Through the years of being broke I've figured out ways to make a better living for myself. Certificates to get, how to afford finishing college. Financial literacy is key. Emotional resilience is key and I don't want to give up on the life I envisioned for myself. And if you’re struggling, I see you. My DMs are open. You matter. 💙",t2_p368s,I wanted to go and I'm glad that I didn't,False,t3_1jdkyqc,0.5,0,2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,0,False,modmsg,1742238662.0,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(edited with AI for length)&lt;/p&gt;
