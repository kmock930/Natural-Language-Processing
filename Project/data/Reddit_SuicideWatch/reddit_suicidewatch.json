Every trip to the supermarket is super depressing these days. My income doesn't go up, but prices go up every other day.\n\nI'm tired all the time, old hobbies don't bring joy any more.

For two and a half years now, my wife couldn't cook or clean any more, so additionally to working full time I also have to cook and clean, I have to take our son (who has developmental problems) to the train station (for school), do all the shopping, etc.\n\nI'm a foreigner here (Japan). I'm doing my taxes in a foreign language (Japanese), making doctor's and psychologist's appointments for my family. Freelancing has ups and downs (way more downs than ups), so I also do several side gigs (teaching languages, doing speeches etc.) just to keep afloat financially.\n\nIt's becoming too much.

I'm writing this at 5 am and it's mostly stream of consciousness. If this is the wrong subreddit for this type of post, please let me know.**\n\nI think I'm a fairly logical person. If I see a problem, I look for the reason why the problem arises to determine a solution. But my current life and mental state is so far removed from what it should be given my upbringing and past experiences that I feel like there's something inherently wrong with me. The way things are now, I'll probably end up killing myself after my parents die.\n\nEach day feels like I'm turning the key on one of those wind up toys and letting it run while I watch. It waddles for a bit, and then encounters a bump and falls over. The next day when I wind it up, I start it at a different trajectory, but it still manages to run into the same bump and fall over. No matter what I try to do, the same result occurs.\n\nI feel like a stranger to my own thoughts. It's as if my corporeal self is separate from my consciousness. My consciousness is constantly aware that what my corporeal self is doing is hurting me, but it's as if it's stuck behind a one way mirror, yelling and pleading without response. \n\nThe only thing I truly enjoy is reading books and manga, and building worlds of my own because it is the only way I can forget about what I'm feeling by appeasing my consciousness and distracting it. When I return to reality, the cycle begins anew. \n\nI have genuinely amazing parents who truly care about me, which is why it makes it all the more difficult and confusing. There have not been any traumatic incidents I can recall that might have caused me to develop depression or whatever thing I have. The only thing I can think of is one incident in middle school (over 6 years ago) where I ruined a friendship with two other people because I mistook kindness for love, but I've felt this way since even before I met them. The other thing is that I lost three of my grandparents during the pandemic, and I was particularly close with one of them. I didn't shed any tears and thought I was heartless for not feeling sad. But, again, I've felt this way even before they died.\n\nI truly believe that I am worthless. No matter what I do, it will never be enough. I hate the way I look not because of any particular objectively ugly feature, but simply because it is me. I hate the way I talk because it is my voice. I hate the way my mind works because it is my brain. I've even managed to convince myself that my parents praise me because they feel obligated to since I am their son, the product of them. My parents don't place high expectations on me. All they desire is for me to be happy and live a better life than they did. But I feel guilty. Guilty that I think this way. Guilty that I'm taking advantage of their kindness without any hopes of repayment. And so I place these expectations on myself that grow taller and taller until I finally broke last Fall.\n\nMy parents were concerned, but I brushed them off. In my eyes, as long as they perceived that I was happy, that would be enough to make them happy. As I was doing this introspection, I realized that my current mentality is similar to that of someone raised in a stereotypical strict Asian household (apologizing a lot, etc). I am Asian, yes, but my parents specifically avoided this when raising me. But not to the extent that they reached the other extreme.\n\nIn high school, I managed to insert myself into one of my middle school acquaintance's friend group. Though, it never went beyond playing games together and helping each other with homework. It just felt as a way to pass the time. I tried to build closer relationships with them, but it soon went back to the usual.\n\nIn college, I don't think I have a single person I can call a friend within my age group. The only ones who actually know me are my professors and my colleagues at a research lab I'm working at. I've talked to the people next to me in lectures, but I don't think they remember my name and just don't care enough to ask. I've tried getting closer to people I meet in classes, but I see them moving away and I stop.\n\nThis semester, I managed to keep up my outer appearances. My grades dropped significantly in Fall, and so that my parents don't worry about me, I can't let that happen again. It's so difficult to do simple things. Taking out the trash feels like climbing a mountain. Going out to get groceries feels like the Walk of Atonement Cersei did in GoT. I eventually get to them, but only after days of procrastination and my brain yelling at me to do so. The one thing I always make sure of is that I am clean and presentable when I step out of my apartment to go to campus/lab.\n\nI crave close relationships, whether it be romantic or platonic. In high school I thought I was in love with two of my female friends (at separate times), but I remembered what happened in middle school and realized that I wasn't feeling love. I simply just wasn't used to this level of kindness from the opposite gender. In my research lab, I'm fairly close with my mentor. I think I'm able to do so because she is married (though she is still not that much older than me). I purposefully distance myself from my other female colleagues because I'm scared that I might fall in 'love' again and ruin my chances to keep working at the lab (because my parents would start asking questions).\n\nI'm scared. Scared that people that I might get close to might see through me. See that there really is nothing special at all about me. Nothing remotely interesting. Nothing that would make them want to keep associating with me. All they would see is someone who's just messed up. What if my parents knew? I know that they keep telling me that they love me no matter what, but what if they reject me? I feel terrible for doubting them.\n\nWhenever I think self-deprecating thoughts like 'You will be the end of your bloodline, because there is no woman in this world charitable enough to put up with you' (this is just the first thing that came to mind), I feel a strangely comforting feeling in my chest. No, I don't think I'm a masochist. It's more as if my body is confirming that this is how things should be.\n\nI know that I'm not ready for a romantic relationship. I know that all I will do is hurt my partner. But I just want to hold someone. I want to feel safe with them and them with me. It's not even about sex (not that I have any experience), I just want validation from someone other than my parents that I am worthy of being loved. Of course this is just me being delusional, and the consequence of reading too many romance mangas. No really I've unironically read over 1000 in the past 6 months. Huh, maybe that's the problem.\n\nEven now, I feel like I'm making excuses and trying to blame my mistakes on things that I'm imagining to be real. It's telling me \"You have it so good. You have good parents, are in a good school and managed to get into a good research lab, so why the hell are you sad?\". It feels like a war inside my head. \n\nI just realized that the characters I've written for my stories are basically just snippets of my mentality, but with believable backstories. I wanted to give them nice character arcs where they learn to become happy. But then I realized that I can't write that because I myself don't know the answer.\n\nI genuinely don't know what the point is of anything. Chasing fleeting moments of happiness? Gaining knowledge? Is it really worth the pain of existing? I never want to inflict the pain of losing their only son on my parents, so I guess I'm just stuck here until they pass on. Then I'll probably have to apologize for the rest of the afterlife, if there is one.\n\nThere is a part of me that believes that this post is just a way for me to garner sympathy and for people to pity me, or its just guilting people into validating me (hoping that you'll praise my word choice, analogies, sentence structure, etc.). I see the other posts on this subreddit of those who have the same thoughts as me. They've had terrible family situations, have been sexually assaulted or gone through other traumatic experiences. And then you have me, who has no reason to feel this way. I really just don't understand.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, thank you for reading this. Sorry that it turned out to be so long.

It&amp;#39;s not even about sex (not that I have any experience), I just want validation from someone other than my parents that I am worthy of being loved. Of course this is just me being delusional, and the consequence of reading too many romance mangas. No really I&amp;#39;ve unironically read over 1000 in the past 6 months. Huh, maybe that&amp;#39;s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even now, I feel like I&amp;#39;m making excuses and trying to blame my mistakes on things that I&amp;#39;m imagining to be real. It&amp;#39;s telling me &amp;quot;You have it so good. You have good parents, are in a good school and managed to get into a good research lab, so why the hell are you sad?&amp;quot;. It feels like a war inside my head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just realized that the characters I&amp;#39;ve written for my stories are basically just snippets of my mentality, but with believable backstories. I wanted to give them nice character arcs where they learn to become happy. But then I realized that I can&amp;#39;t write that because I myself don&amp;#39;t know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I genuinely don&amp;#39;t know what the point is of anything. Chasing fleeting moments of happiness? Gaining knowledge? Is it really worth the pain of existing? I never want to inflict the pain of losing their only son on my parents, so I guess I&amp;#39;m just stuck here until they pass on. Then I&amp;#39;ll probably have to apologize for the rest of the afterlife, if there is one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a part of me that believes that this post is just a way for me to garner sympathy and for people to pity me, or its just guilting people into validating me (hoping that you&amp;#39;ll praise my word choice, analogies, sentence structure, etc.). I see the other posts on this subreddit of those who have the same thoughts as me. They&amp;#39;ve had terrible family situations, have been sexually assaulted or gone through other traumatic experiences. And then you have me, who has no reason to feel this way. I really just don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve gotten this far, thank you for reading this. Sorry that it turned out to be so long. All I hope is that my parents don&amp;#39;t find this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1j6h893", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Creepy_Substance", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1j6h893/im_just_confused_how_i_turned_out_this_way/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1j6h893/im_just_confused_how_i_turned_out_this_way/", "subreddit_subscribers": 518481, "created_utc": 1741440749.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext": "I have just lost everything I have ever built, I can\u2019t face it anymore and I just want to know how quickly this will happen.

It's the month where it's no one's birthday or that any special occasions take place. I have a loving family and some friends but I'm deeply depressed. I can't go on with life anymore. I've posted earlier about how I know this is the end for me. I have no future. \n\nBut my family doesn't deserve to be left with nothing. I want to die as soon as I can, I actually don't feel like waiting anymore but I want to make something that will help them after I'm gone. I'm going to write a book and that's all I'm going to put my energy into these next few months. \n\nI'm also going to take up a new hobby. I'm going to take random hikes and find a place where I can make my death look like an accident. After I found a place, I'll go back on 20 October and just get it done with. \n\nI actually planned something like this before. I was supposed to be dead already. 19 January, the day before my birthday. But my brother in law proposed to my sister at the same place I chose to kill myself. I couldn't go through with it anymore. \n\nI didn't want to spoil such a special place for them. The only issue is it was the closest hiking trail.

I\u2019ve been scared to tell people, but I do hear things/voices and see things. Not all the time, but I can even remember being a little kid and experiencing this but not like imaginary friends, I don\u2019t even know how to explain it. Sometimes it\u2019s me sometimes it\u2019s people I know sometimes it\u2019s strangers Sometimes it\u2019s like shadows? I also sometimes can have out of body experiences where it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even in control of who I am. (I\u2019ve met with a therapist twice and did not disclose this in fear of what it might be. If this sounds familiar to anyone or they have any knowledge, please share) \n\nSince I\u2019ve been introduced to harder drugs, the voices have increased during use and now after as well. I find myself talking back to it a lot and then if I\u2019m around people, I have to check myself. Or say sorry I was talking to myself, which is true sometimes. However, it\u2019s been a toxic cycle because it seems these drugs are the only thing that kind of numb it as well? \n\nAnyways, here comes the confession. I did attempt when I was 14. But that was silly and doesn\u2019t feel real. I mean it happened, but I didn\u2019t grasp it. Now as a 24 year old, I do fully understand what it would mean. My drug addiction has become a problem. I take really large amounts, don\u2019t test stuff, and really don\u2019t care but that\u2019s not necessarily attempts. Recently, I was in a very intense drug induced psychosis that lasted for almost 48 hours. I accused the people closest of me of doing something and even contacted the police. It was so silly. I thought that they were hiding someone in my apartment. I felt so much shame and embarrassment, on top of my already terrible depression. I wrote a note, got really drunk, and started to take pills. It was like an out of body experience. I was staring at myself in the mirror crying and hitting myself and yelling at myself to do it but then a small part would fight back.

I\u2019ve been scared to tell people, but I do hear things/voices and see things. Not all the time, but I can even remember being a little kid and experiencing this but not like imaginary friends, I don\u2019t even know how to explain it. Sometimes it\u2019s me sometimes it\u2019s people I know sometimes it\u2019s strangers Sometimes it\u2019s like shadows? I also sometimes can have out of body experiences where it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even in control of who I am. (I\u2019ve met with a therapist twice and did not disclose this in fear of what it might be. If this sounds familiar to anyone or they have any knowledge, please share) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I\u2019ve been introduced to harder drugs, the voices have increased during use and now after as well. I find myself talking back to it a lot and then if I\u2019m around people, I have to check myself. Or say sorry I was talking to myself, which is true sometimes. However, it\u2019s been a toxic cycle because it seems these drugs are the only thing that kind of numb it as well? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, here comes the confession. I did attempt when I was 14. But that was silly and doesn\u2019t feel real. I mean it happened, but I didn\u2019t grasp it. Now as a 24 year old, I do fully understand what it would mean. My drug addiction has become a problem. I take really large amounts, don\u2019t test stuff, and really don\u2019t care but that\u2019s not necessarily attempts. Recently, I was in a very intense drug induced psychosis that lasted for almost 48 hours. I accused the people closest of me of doing something and even contacted the police. It was so silly. I thought that they were hiding someone in my apartment. I felt so much shame and embarrassment, on top of my already terrible depression. I wrote a note, got really drunk, and started to take pills. It was like an out of body experience. I was staring at myself in the mirror crying and hitting myself and yelling at myself to do it but then a small part would fight back. Obviously nothing happened and I\u2019m here and no one knows. Except now whoever anonymously chooses to stick through my long confession. It\u2019s truly terrifying to have my brain some days.

Trans guy. Yes we exist. Not deep enough into transitioning to pass but deep enough for people to know something is off. Got threatened on the street a couple weeks ago. Obviously everything is going to shit so don't need to tell y'all that part.\n\nI've always struggled with people. I try so hard to talk to be nice but it just never comes out right. I don't know why. I really try hard but it never seems to matter\n\nMy father was emotionally abusive. I suspect a sexual assualt happened but I can't remember. I brought the concern up once to my sister and she got mad at me. \n\nUnfortunately, that's sort of the theme of my life. I begged to not see my father when i was a teenager, 14, and was told it was more important i have relationship with him. He was incredibly mean my entire life, especially when he drank. My parents had no idea who I was or what I was doing as a teenager. They didn't talk to me about my feelings and after that incident I shut down. I don't remember most of my childhood other than moments of abuse or emotional neglect. But it never mattered to anyone. I was put in therapy and I was able to lie to the therapists to make them think I was okay. That went on until I had a complete mental break at 23, after I graduated college in 2020. My boyfriend who ritually blacked out and forgot what consent was managed to convince my entire friend group to abandon me.\n\nI have tried so hard since then. So much therapy, suicide attempts, multiple misdiagnoses. I thought i was better. I believe in my convictions and can be passionate but I try so hard to not make people feel bad. I guess i fail no matter what.\n\nAnyway. I guess I'm just broken at this point. No fixing it. I try my best but it just doesn't work out. Even when i try to apologize for something, I always fail. I'm just at my core a bad person, I guess\n\nThe point. Recently, a close family member shared something from his old white professor. It was advice about doomscrolling but the wording just sent me spiraling. I'm so afraid all the time, I was shocked to see it in my family chat. \n\n\"Sometimes, you have to let the building burn and come back to clean up the ashes.\"\n\nSo. As a trans person. I'm the ashes. I wont say i reacted well but i tried my best and I wasnt going to pretend like it didn't hurt. \n\nAnother family member tried to be supportive but I just felt like it wasn't entirely genuine. I tried to share those feelings, i tried so hard to communicate how I felt in a good way. I said I wasn't angry, I didn't attack them, i just said I felt unsupported. They blew up at me. I didn't bring it up again. On Sunday, we were smoking and I said i wasn't really talking to the person who sent that message. She rolled her eyes so hard at me. Like my feelings still don't matter. It doesn't matter how hurt I was and that I haven't gotten an apology. What matters is me keeping my mouth shut. That's how it feels anyway, but I guess I can't trust my feelings so who knows.\n\nThis family member had moved recently and I've been keeping a ton of their stuff in my apartment. Literally half my apartment was taken up by it. This week, they're back for spring break and the first half of the week didn't say anything about helping me take care of it. \n\nI have had a very hard few weeks. I got threatened on the street. I found out I will have to see my ex (the one who blacked out regularly) soon. I am so poor and I'm not eating more than a sandwich a day. i was recently in the ER for acitosis. I failed at everything I wanted to do. I have a few friends but no one who would do ANYTHING for me, you know? Idk. \n\nAnyway, I walked into my apartment and I just broke. I told the family member if the stuff wasn't out by Saturday (it was Wednesday when I sent it) then I would sell it or get rid of it. I was upset but I made sure the messages didn't attack them, I didn't insult them, i said Please. According to them, my tone was off but I don't know how to fix that when I tried so hard to be firm in my boundary but still polite. Not enough, i guess, never enough. \n\nWe had a good night tonight. She brought up that it felt better in my apartment noe that that was gone. I said I was sorry if it had come off bad but that the intensity of how much stuff was there was a lot and I had broke and i tried to be nice but i was sorry if it came off bad. \n\nShe said if i felt like that, i just shouldnt say anything. \n\nI tried to tell her how disrespected I have felt and that day it just was too much. That i tried just now to say sorry it came off bad. But it never matters. It just is never enough. She didn't want to talk about it anymore, which always happens. She can say she doesn't want to talk about something but if I say that then I get sent \"\ud83d\ude44 lol\". So. \n\nAnyway we fought because of course we did. I tried to stay calm. I feel like she got angry immediately just at me saying anything about how hurt I felt. Like I'm not allowed to be hurt or have those feelings. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I shouldn't feel anything at all and then they'll be happy. They were happy when i was on enough drugs to become a zombie. I guess that's what they like.\n\ni just feel so broken. Like I can't say anything about how I feel without being attacked. I can't apologize without being attacked. It doesn't matter how rude anyone else is to me, it is ultimately my fault no matter what I do. \n\nSo I'm done. I tried my best for the last five years. I think that's enough time to know that it's just not worth it. I am not allowed to be annoyed or angry. I have to be perfect or it isn't enough. \n\nThat's how it feels anyway. But at this point, i don't even trust it. If everyone says I'm wrong, I must be. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. They only seem happy when i shut up and take it and swallow it and let it kill me slowly. \n\nI can't die slowly for them anymore. It's likely that I will be affected by this administration anyway. I've already been threatened, followed, watched. I'd rather go out this way than by some transphobic asshole. Better than to be institutionalized in a year or arrested for \"misrepresenting my gender\" or whatever reason they're gonna find to kill us. Me. \n\nThis is so long. I'm sorry. I really try so hard. I wish it had been enough, just this once. I think I'm gonna do gas? Seems painless and when they find me I shouldn't be mutilated, right? They won't see me like that? I don't want to cause them more pain but I know everything will be better when I'm gone.", "author_fullname": "t2_4kjspcfv", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I Don't Think i can keep going", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1j6denn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1741425946.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1741425191.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idk I guess that&amp;#39;s it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 27. Trans guy. Yes we exist. Not deep enough into transitioning to pass but deep enough for people to know something is off. Got threatened on the street a couple weeks ago. Obviously everything is going to shit so don&amp;#39;t need to tell y&amp;#39;all that part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always struggled with people. I try so hard to talk to be nice but it just never comes out right. I don&amp;#39;t know why. I really try hard but it never seems to matter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father was emotionally abusive. I suspect a sexual assualt happened but I can&amp;#39;t remember. I brought the concern up once to my sister and she got mad at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that&amp;#39;s sort of the theme of my life. I begged to not see my father when i was a teenager, 14, and was told it was more important i have relationship with him. He was incredibly mean my entire life, especially when he drank. My parents had no idea who I was or what I was doing as a teenager. They didn&amp;#39;t talk to me about my feelings and after that incident I shut down. I don&amp;#39;t remember most of my childhood other than moments of abuse or emotional neglect. But it never mattered to anyone. I was put in therapy and I was able to lie to the therapists to make them think I was okay. That went on until I had a complete mental break at 23, after I graduated college in 2020. My boyfriend who ritually blacked out and forgot what consent was managed to convince my entire friend group to abandon me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have tried so hard since then. So much therapy, suicide attempts, multiple misdiagnoses. I thought i was better. I believe in my convictions and can be passionate but I try so hard to not make people feel bad. I guess i fail no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I guess I&amp;#39;m just broken at this point. No fixing it. I try my best but it just doesn&amp;#39;t work out. Even when i try to apologize for something, I always fail. I&amp;#39;m just at my core a bad person, I guess&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point. Recently, a close family member shared something from his old white professor. It was advice about doomscrolling but the wording just sent me spiraling. I&amp;#39;m so afraid all the time, I was shocked to see it in my family chat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sometimes, you have to let the building burn and come back to clean up the ashes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So. As a trans person. I&amp;#39;m the ashes. I wont say i reacted well but i tried my best and I wasnt going to pretend like it didn&amp;#39;t hurt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another family member tried to be supportive but I just felt like it wasn&amp;#39;t entirely genuine. I tried to share those feelings, i tried so hard to communicate how I felt in a good way. I said I wasn&amp;#39;t angry, I didn&amp;#39;t attack them, i just said I felt unsupported. They blew up at me. I didn&amp;#39;t bring it up again. On Sunday, we were smoking and I said i wasn&amp;#39;t really talking to the person who sent that message. She rolled her eyes so hard at me. Like my feelings still don&amp;#39;t matter. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how hurt I was and that I haven&amp;#39;t gotten an apology. What matters is me keeping my mouth shut. That&amp;#39;s how it feels anyway, but I guess I can&amp;#39;t trust my feelings so who knows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This family member had moved recently and I&amp;#39;ve been keeping a ton of their stuff in my apartment. Literally half my apartment was taken up by it. This week, they&amp;#39;re back for spring break and the first half of the week didn&amp;#39;t say anything about helping me take care of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have had a very hard few weeks. I got threatened on the street. I found out I will have to see my ex (the one who blacked out regularly) soon. I am so poor and I&amp;#39;m not eating more than a sandwich a day. i was recently in the ER for acitosis. I failed at everything I wanted to do. I have a few friends but no one who would do ANYTHING for me, you know? Idk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I walked into my apartment and I just broke. I told the family member if the stuff wasn&amp;#39;t out by Saturday (it was Wednesday when I sent it) then I would sell it or get rid of it. I was upset but I made sure the messages didn&amp;#39;t attack them, I didn&amp;#39;t insult them, i said Please. According to them, my tone was off but I don&amp;#39;t know how to fix that when I tried so hard to be firm in my boundary but still polite. Not enough, i guess, never enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a good night tonight. She brought up that it felt better in my apartment noe that that was gone.
