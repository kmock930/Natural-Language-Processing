         "I reached a really low point today. I am struggling a lot financially trying to support my two kids. I may lose my house. I work full time and I do my best but it's never enough. I made a whole plan today to get a huge life insurance policy. One that still pays out after unaliving, and I figure I just wait the year or so and then I will know they are well taken care of for the rest of their lives. \r\n\r\nIt is better for them I think to have the structure of keeping their home and not having to worry about their next meal or clothes or anything. I promised myself they would never need for anything. \r\n\r\nIDK what else to do because I feel like that's exactly what a good mother would do. Anything for their children.

Every day it hurts more and more. I'm mentally ill and there's no cure for my disease. I've seen a million doctors and been on all kinds of antidepressants for almost 10 years and it only gets harder as time goes on. I just want my pain to end, but i can't tell my family about my suicidal thoughts or my doctor. I don't want to be taken away again and i don't want to scare anyone, but i don't want to hurt my mom either. I never had the best relationship with my family and i don't want them to blame themselves because they did all that they could. I don't know how much longer i can do this. I just want to sleep forever and never wake up. I don't have a single friend and sometimes i wish i could just get a hug from somebody, literally anybody. I just want to be held, but i can't even find anyone to do that. No one gives a fuck either. People always abandon me when they tell me they'll always be here for me, but they're never anywhere to be found. The thought of killing myself used to scare me and i would always wonder where i would go, but now the thought of it makes me feel calm and i really don't care what's on the other side anymore or even if there is another side. I never knew what it was like to truly be happy and feel loved. I feel so trapped. I don't know what else to do. I emailed them and inquired about prices. They responded and i told myself i would delete it, but i still have it. That's honestly what scares me. I'm not afraid to die anymore. I can't even sleep and suffer from horrible insomnia and addiction. I can't remember the last time i genuinely felt tired without sleeping pills. ",
